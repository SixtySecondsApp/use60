## Template Design Principles

Every post-meeting email template in this library follows five non-negotiable principles:

### 1. The "What We Heard" Technique Is Mandatory

The single most effective element of any post-meeting email is reflecting the buyer's own words back to them. This technique:
- **Validates their concerns** — they feel heard and understood
- **Creates accountability** — both sides agree on what was said
- **Prevents misalignment** — catches misunderstandings before they compound
- **Increases reply rates by 3.1x** compared to generic recaps (Lavender, 2023)

### 2. Decisions and Next Steps Must Have Owners and Deadlines

Every decision listed must identify who agreed to it. Every next step must have a named owner and a specific deadline. "We'll follow up next week" is not a next step — it is a wish.

### 3. One CTA, Always

End with exactly one specific ask. Not "let me know your thoughts." Not two options for next steps. One concrete action that moves the deal forward.

### 4. Three Variants for Every Template

Each template is provided in three variants:
- **Concise** (60-90 words): For executive recipients or simple meetings
- **Detailed** (150-200 words): For operational stakeholders who need completeness
- **Executive** (40-60 words): For C-suite forwards or time-constrained readers

### 5. Never Re-Pitch

The email recaps what was DISCUSSED, not what you WISH you had discussed. Never include features, capabilities, or product information that was not part of the actual meeting conversation.

## Discovery Recap Templates

2. **Value-forward**: "Your Team's Top 3 Priorities from Our Call"

## Internal vs. Buyer-Facing Variants

### What Changes Between Internal and External Emails

| Element | Buyer-Facing Email | Internal Update |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Language** | Their words, neutral framing | Your honest assessment, internal jargon OK |
| **Risks** | Mentioned diplomatically if at all | Stated explicitly and candidly |
| **Deal stage** | Never mentioned | Always mentioned with signal (green/yellow/red) |
| **Competitive intel** | Never included | Always flagged if relevant |
| **Pricing details** | Only if explicitly approved for sharing | Full internal pricing context |
| **Stakeholder dynamics** | Only professional references | Honest assessment of champions, blockers, power dynamics |
| **Your opinion** | Objective, fact-based | Subjective assessment welcome ("I think they're ready to move") |
| **Tone** | Professional, buyer-first | Direct, candid, action-oriented |

### What Should NEVER Appear in a Buyer-Facing Email

1. Internal deal stage names (e.g., "Moving this to Stage 4")
2. CRM terminology (e.g., "deal_id", "pipeline score")
3. Internal team commentary (e.g., "Our VP wants to close this by month-end")
4. Competitive positioning language (e.g., "This is a competitive deal against [Competitor]")
5. Discount authority or margin information
6. Other prospect or customer names without their permission
7. Off-the-record meeting comments
8. Your personal assessment of their likelihood to buy
