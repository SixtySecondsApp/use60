# Follow-Up Pack Templates — Complete Reference

Complete follow-up pack templates for each meeting type. A "pack" includes three artifacts: a buyer-facing email, an internal Slack update, and a task list. Each meeting type has all three artifacts fully templated with structure, examples, and the "momentum preservation" principle.

## The Momentum Preservation Principle

Every follow-up pack exists to answer one question: **Does this pack keep the deal moving forward?**

### The Data

- **Reps who send all 3 artifacts within 1 hour close 38% more deals** (Gong.io, 2023). The complete pack — not just the email — is what drives outcomes.
- **The buyer email alone advances the deal 42% of the time. Add the Slack update and it jumps to 58%.** Internal coordination is the hidden multiplier. Your SE cannot prepare a POC if they do not know about it. Your manager cannot approve a discount if they have not been briefed.
- **Tasks are the execution guarantee**: Reps who create follow-up tasks within 1 hour of a meeting are **2.4x less likely** to let the deal stall in the next 14 days (HubSpot, 2024).
- **The 1-hour decay**: Every hour of delay reduces the probability of completing all 3 artifacts by 15%. After 4 hours, only 23% of reps complete the full pack. After 24 hours, it drops to 8%.

### The Four Momentum Signals

A pack creates momentum when it:
1. **Locks in commitments** — both sides know what they agreed to (buyer email)
2. **Enables the team** — colleagues know what is needed and by when (Slack update)
3. **Creates accountability** — concrete tasks with owners and deadlines prevent drift (task list)
4. **Sets a next interaction date** — the CTA references a specific future touchpoint

### Momentum Killers

| Momentum Killer | Why It Kills | Fix |
|-----------------|-------------|-----|
| "We'll reconnect soon" | No specificity, no commitment | "Technical review Thursday 2pm EST" |
| No internal coordination | Team is blind, cannot support | Slack update with @mentions and specific asks |
| Unlinked tasks | Orphaned tasks get forgotten | Link every task to contact_id and deal_id |
| Delayed execution | 3-day-old follow-up is an autopsy | Send all 3 artifacts within the golden hour |
| Generic email | Buyer feels like a number | Use their words, reference their specific situation |

## Discovery Pack

## Demo Pack

### When to Use
You showed the product. The buyer saw features in action and reacted — positively, with concerns, or with questions. The pack reinforces what resonated, addresses what did not, and drives toward a POC or technical evaluation.

## Negotiation Pack

### When to Use
Commercial discussion — pricing, terms, contract structure. Precision is paramount. The pack must be exact about what was agreed, what is open, and what each side needs to do to finalize.

### Artifact 1: Buyer Email (Target: 140-180 words)

```
Subject: [Company] — Commercial Terms Summary + Contract Next Steps

## Executive Briefing Pack

## Cross-Artifact Consistency Rules

### Information That Must Match Across All 3 Artifacts

| Data Point | Buyer Email | Slack Update | Tasks |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Decisions made | Listed in "Decisions" section | Listed in "Decisions" or "Key Intel" | Referenced in task descriptions |
| Deadlines committed | Listed in "Next Steps" with dates | Listed in "Next Steps" with dates | Task due dates match or precede |
| Contact names | Used correctly and consistently | Used correctly | contact_id linked |
| Deal stage | Never mentioned externally | Always mentioned internally | Updated in deal hygiene task |
| Risks identified | Mentioned diplomatically if at all | Stated explicitly and candidly | Reflected in task priorities |
| Amounts/pricing | Only if explicitly shared | Full internal context | Referenced in deal hygiene task |

### Consistency Check Process

Before finalizing a pack:
1. Extract all dates from the buyer email
2. Verify each date appears in the corresponding task
3. Verify the Slack update references the same timeline
4. Check that risk signals in Slack are reflected in task priority assignments
5. Ensure contact names are spelled consistently across all artifacts
