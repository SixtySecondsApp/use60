  Query and filter results from completed Apify runs stored in the mapped_records table.
  Supports natural language filters like "show me contacts with VP title from the last scrape",

# Apify Results Query

## Goal
Query and filter mapped results from completed Apify actor runs using natural language filters.

## Required Capabilities
- **Apify API**: Results stored in `apify_results` / `apify_mapped_records` tables, queried via `apify-admin` edge function

## Inputs
- `run_id`: Optional run ID (defaults to most recent completed run)
- `filter_description`: Natural language filter criteria
- `columns`: Optional column selection
- `limit`: Row limit (default 50)

## Execution
1. If no `run_id` provided, fetch the most recent completed run for the user's organization
2. Translate `filter_description` into SQL-compatible filters on `apify_mapped_records`
3. Call `apify-admin` with `action: 'query_results'`, run ID, and filters
4. Present results as a table with GDPR flags highlighted
5. Offer follow-up actions: "export to CSV", "push to CRM", "push to Instantly"

## GDPR Handling
Results may contain personal email flags (`is_personal_email`). When present:
- Show a warning badge on flagged rows
- Suggest the user review before exporting or pushing to outbound tools
- Count and display total flagged records

## Output Contract
Return a table with the mapped columns from the actor run, plus:
- GDPR Flag column (if personal emails detected)
- Total count and page info
