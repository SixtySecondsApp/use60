# Anti-Patterns — What Kills Cold Emails

Reference this file when reviewing generated emails for quality. If any email triggers these patterns, rewrite it.

## The Dead Language List

These phrases signal "corporate email" to the reader's brain and trigger the ignore reflex. Never use them.

| Dead Phrase | What a Human Says |
|------------|------------------|
| "I'm reaching out because..." | [Just start with the point] |
| "I hope this email finds you well" | [Delete entirely] |
| "Allow me to introduce myself" | [Delete entirely] |
| "My name is X and I work for Y" | [Delete — your signature handles this] |
| "Elevate your outreach effectiveness" | "Send emails people reply to" |
| "Optimize your revenue operations" | "Fix the gap between your CRM and pipeline" |
| "I'd love to explore potential synergies" | "I think we can help each other" |
| "Leverage our best-in-class platform" | "Our tool does [specific thing] better" |
| "Drive meaningful engagement" | "Get your team on the same page" |
| "Transforming prospect engagement" | "Getting prospects to actually respond" |
| "Unique perspective" | [Be specific about what's unique] |
| "Industry-leading solution" | [Name what it actually does] |
| "Streamline your workflow" | "Save 3 hours a week on [specific task]" |
| "Empower your team" | "Help your team [do specific thing]" |
| "Cutting-edge technology" | [Describe what it does, not what it is] |
| "Just following up" | [Give a new reason to engage] |
| "Just checking in" | [Give a new reason to engage] |
| "Bumping this to the top of your inbox" | [Give a new reason to engage] |
| "Per my last email" | [Reference the topic, not the email] |
| "circle back" | "revisit" or "pick this up again" |

## AI-Generated Email Tells

Recipients (often unconsciously) detect these patterns. Avoid them.

### 1. Uniform Sentence Length
**AI does:** Every sentence is 12-18 words. Consistent rhythm throughout.
**Humans do:** Long sentence explaining something complex. Then short. A question? Then a fragment for emphasis. Mix it up.

### 2. Generic Compliments
**AI does:** "I was impressed by your company's growth trajectory and innovative approach to the market."
**Humans do:** "Saw you just opened the Austin office. That's a big move for a 30-person team."

### 3. Over-Qualification and Hedging
**AI does:** "I was just wondering if perhaps you might possibly be interested in..."
**Humans do:** "Interested?"

### 4. Perfect Grammar Everywhere
**AI does:** Flawless prose, proper semicolons, no fragments.
**Humans do:** Start sentences with "And." Use dashes — like this — instead of semicolons. Write fragments. On purpose.

### 5. Absence of First-Person Voice
**AI does:** "Companies often find that..." / "Teams typically experience..."
**Humans do:** "I noticed..." / "We just dealt with the same thing..." / "My team found..."

### 6. Buzzword Density
**AI does:** Trained on public business writing, defaults to "optimize," "leverage," "streamline."
**Humans do:** Use plain words for plain concepts. "Fix" not "optimize." "Use" not "leverage."

### 7. The "I'd Love To" Pattern
**AI does:** "I'd love to schedule a quick call to discuss how we might be able to help your team..."
**Humans do:** "Got 10 minutes this week?"

## Structural Anti-Patterns

### Wall of Text
One long paragraph = death. The reader's brain sees effort required and closes the email.

**Fix:** One idea per line. White space between thoughts. Never more than 2 sentences in a row without a line break.

### Feature Dumping
Listing product capabilities in Email 1.

**Fix:** Email 1 exists to start a conversation. Save features for after they reply. If you must mention what you do, one sentence max.

### Self-Centered Opening
Starting with "We are..." / "Our company..." / "I am..."

**Fix:** First sentence is always about THEM. Their company, their role, their challenge, something they did.

### Multiple Asks
"Would you like to: (a) schedule a demo, (b) download our whitepaper, (c) attend our webinar?"

**Fix:** One email, one ask. Single CTA. Make it easy.

### Fancy Formatting
Multiple font colors, bold everywhere, bullet-pointed feature lists, embedded images.

**Fix:** Plain text. Maybe one bold word for emphasis. HTML formatting triggers spam filters and looks promotional.

## Teardown: The Bad Email (from the platform)

Here's the actual email the platform is currently producing, with every problem annotated:

```
Wayne,

I'm reaching out because your frontline sales experience at EXB(UK)LTD
gives you a unique perspective on what actually works in automotive
outreach.
```
**Problems:**
- "I'm reaching out because" = dead language, self-centered opener
- "unique perspective" = vague corporate compliment
- "what actually works in automotive outreach" = generic, could be sent to anyone in automotive

```
We're hosting an AI Roundtable Breakfast on 6th March 2026, 9am - 11am
at The Harbour Hotel, Bristol, where sales professionals like yourself
will explore how video-powered attraction strategies are transforming
prospect engagement.
```
**Problems:**
- 43-word sentence = wall of text
- "sales professionals like yourself" = generic, makes them feel like a segment, not a person
- "explore how video-powered attraction strategies are transforming prospect engagement" = peak corporate speak, 10 buzzwords in one clause
- Buries the WHAT (an event) in a dense paragraph
- All about the EVENT, nothing about what WAYNE gets out of it

```
Given your role connecting with commercial vehicle clients, I think
you'd bring valuable insights to the conversation while discovering
approaches that could elevate your outreach effectiveness.
```
**Problems:**
- "Given your role" = generic
- "bring valuable insights" = flattery that feels hollow
- "elevate your outreach effectiveness" = corporate speak, means nothing specific
- This sentence is about what Wayne can GIVE to the event, not what he GETS

```
Would you be interested in joining us?
```
**Problems:**
- Weak, generic CTA
- "joining us" = vague
- No curiosity, no urgency, no reason to reply NOW
- Could be answered "no" too easily

**Total: 82 words, ~12th grade reading level, zero curiosity gap, corporate tone**

### The Rewrite:

```
Wayne — you sell commercial vehicles at EXB. Quick question:

When you reach out to fleet managers, do they actually watch the
videos you send?

We ran a breakfast in Bristol last month where 12 sales pros shared
what's working. One guy doubled his reply rate in 3 weeks.

Running another March 6th. Tiny group, no pitches, just tactics.

Worth a seat?
```

**What changed:**
- 56 words (vs 82)
- ~5th grade reading level (vs ~12th)
- Opens with SPECIFIC detail about Wayne's actual job
- Creates curiosity gap: "do they actually watch?" — he has to think about this
- Social proof: "12 sales pros" and "doubled his reply rate" — concrete, not abstract
- Scarcity: "tiny group" — feels exclusive
- CTA: "Worth a seat?" — 3 words, easy to answer, low commitment
- Tone: sounds like a person, not a marketing department

## The Psychology Cheat Sheet

When writing or reviewing emails, these are the principles ranked by impact:

1. **Relevance** — Is this specifically about them and their reality right now?
2. **Cognitive ease** — Can they process and respond in under 10 seconds?
3. **Curiosity** — Did you open a gap they need to close?
4. **Reciprocity** — Did you give them something valuable first?
5. **Identity alignment** — Does this speak to who they want to be?
6. **Social proof** — Are their peers doing this?
7. **Status calibration** — Are you treating them as an equal?
8. **Loss framing** — Are they losing something by not acting?

The best emails nail the top 3-4 and skip the rest. Trying to use all 8 produces bloated, over-engineered emails.
