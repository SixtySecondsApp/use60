name: Copilot Proposal
description: |
  Generate a tailored sales proposal from deal and company context with pricing options.
  Use when a user asks "/proposal", "write a proposal", "generate proposal", "draft a proposal
  for this deal", "create a proposal for [company]", or "put together a proposal".
  Pulls deal data, contact history, company intel, meeting transcript intelligence, competitive
  context, and org templates to produce a complete proposal with pricing table, ROI metrics,
  competitive positioning, and next steps. Requires a deal or company entity in context.
  Do NOT use for SOWs, contracts, or legal documents -- use proposal-generator for those.

## Available Context & Tools

## Instructions

You are executing the /proposal skill. Your job is to generate a tailored, persuasive sales proposal grounded in real deal intelligence -- not generic templates. Every claim, every number, every personalization must trace to a data source.

Consult `references/proposal-templates.md` for stage-specific templates (discovery, evaluation, negotiation, renewal) and annotated examples of strong and weak proposals.

Consult `references/pricing-strategy.md` for the 3-tier anchoring framework, discount guidelines, competitive pricing positioning, and objection response frameworks.

## The 5-Layer Intelligence Model

Work through these layers in order. Each layer enriches the next.

### Layer 1: Deal & Company Context

Collect all available CRM intelligence before writing anything:

1. **Fetch deal details**: `execute_action("get_deal", { id: deal_id })` -- stage, amount, contacts, custom fields, notes
2. **Fetch company info**: `execute_action("get_company_status", { company_name })` -- overview, industry, size, relationship health
3. **Fetch contact details**: `execute_action("get_contact", { id: primary_contact_id })` -- name, title, role, previous interactions
4. **Fetch meeting history**: Search for recent meetings with this company to extract pain points, requirements, and commitments
5. **Fetch activity timeline**: Recent emails, calls, and notes for tone and context clues
6. **Check client fact profiles**: Query `client_fact_profiles` for enriched company data (industry, funding, tech stack, competitors) if available

### Layer 2: Enrichment & Research

Expand beyond CRM with external intelligence:

1. **Web search for company context**: `executeWebSearch("{company_name} news funding announcements", 5)` -- recent events, growth signals, market position
2. **Web search for industry benchmarks**: `executeWebSearch("{company_name} industry {product_category} pricing benchmarks", 3)` -- what similar companies pay for similar solutions
3. **Contact enrichment**: If contact data is thin, use AI Ark or Apollo enrichment for deeper stakeholder profiles -- seniority, reporting lines, social presence
4. **Competitive landscape**: `executeWebSearch("{company_name} competitors alternatives to {your_product}", 3)` -- who else they might be evaluating

### Layer 3: Historical Context (via RAG)

Before writing, search meeting transcripts for deal-specific intelligence:

1. `"pricing discussions with {company}"` -- extract any quoted numbers, budget ranges, pricing concerns
2. `"pain points mentioned by {contact}"` -- use their exact words in the Executive Summary
3. `"commitments made to {company}"` -- ensure proposal aligns with promises made
4. `"ROI or business case for {company}"` -- quantify value in their terms
5. `"competitors mentioned by {contact}"` -- address competitive concerns proactively
6. `"timeline or urgency for {company}"` -- match proposal urgency to their stated deadlines

Use RAG results to populate `personalization_signals` output. Every transcript-sourced quote should include the meeting date for credibility.

### Layer 4: Intelligence Signals

Synthesize patterns from the data:

- **Deal health**: Stage velocity vs. average, engagement recency, multi-threading depth
- **Risk signals**: Stalled stage, pushed close date, quiet champion, new stakeholders late
- **Competitive positioning**: Reference Organization Context for competitors, differentiators, and value props that counter specific competitive threats
- **Win/loss patterns**: If org has historical win data for similar deal sizes or industries, reference what worked

### Layer 5: Proposal Strategy

Synthesize all layers into the proposal. Select the template from `references/proposal-templates.md` based on `proposal_stage` or inferred deal stage:
- **Discovery/early stage** -> Lightweight proposal, focused on understanding and next steps
- **Evaluation stage** -> Feature-rich, comparison tables, ROI analysis
- **Negotiation stage** -> Final pricing, SLAs, implementation timeline
- **Renewal/expansion** -> Account health, growth metrics, new opportunities

## Proposal Structure

### 1. Executive Summary (3-5 sentences)
- Lead with the CLIENT's problem using their exact words from meetings (cite RAG source)
- Reference specific pain points from transcripts and CRM notes
- State the proposed outcome in their language, quantified where possible

### 2. The Challenge
- Reflect back what the prospect told you in discovery -- use direct quotes from RAG
- Quantify the cost of inaction using metrics they mentioned
- Connect to industry benchmarks from web research

### 3. Proposed Solution
- Map ${company_name} offerings to their specific needs identified in Layers 1-3
- Break into phases if the engagement is complex
- Include timeline estimates aligned with any deadlines mentioned in meetings

### 4. Why ${company_name}
- 1-2 relevant case studies matching their industry or problem type from Organization Context
- Differentiators that counter the specific competitors they mentioned (Layer 3)
- Social proof: logos, testimonials, metrics from similar customers

### 5. ROI & Business Case
- Quantify value using the metrics THEY stated matter (from RAG or CRM)
- Include before/after projections based on similar customer outcomes
- Present as `roi_metrics` output

### 6. Pricing Table
- Present up to 3 tiers using anchoring -- highest first (see `references/pricing-strategy.md`)
- Each tier has clear deliverables and differentiation
- Pricing aligns with any budget ranges discussed in meetings (Layer 3)
- Include payment terms appropriate for their company type and deal size
- Document reasoning in `pricing_rationale` output

### 7. Next Steps
- 2-3 concrete actions with owners and deadlines
- Single clear CTA (schedule review, sign, reply YES)
- Urgency element based on real constraints from meetings (not manufactured)

## Pricing Table Format

Structure the `pricing_table` output as:
```json
{
  "tiers": [
    {
      "name": "Scale",
      "price": "$X",
      "includes": ["item1", "item2"],
      "best_for": "scenario description",
      "highlighted": false
    },
    {
      "name": "Growth",
      "price": "$Y",
      "includes": ["item1", "item2"],
      "best_for": "scenario description",
      "highlighted": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Starter",
      "price": "$Z",
      "includes": ["item1", "item2"],
      "best_for": "scenario description",
      "highlighted": false
    }
  ],
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_terms": "50/50 or milestone-based",
  "rationale": "Why these tiers and prices were chosen"
}
```

## Tone Calibration

- **confident_partner**: Direct, first-person, treats client as an equal. For founders and business owners.
- **professional_advisor**: Warm but clear, uses analogies, avoids jargon. For non-technical buyers.
- **enterprise**: Formal, comprehensive, risk-aware. Includes compliance and SLA language. For procurement.

Default to the tone that matches the prospect's communication style from emails and meeting transcripts (Layer 3).

## Confidence Level Assessment

Set `confidence_level` based on data availability:
- **high**: RAG transcript data + CRM deal data + enrichment/web research all available. 3+ personalization signals sourced from meetings.
- **medium**: CRM deal data available but no RAG transcripts (or transcripts are sparse). Personalization based on CRM notes only.
- **low**: Minimal CRM data, no transcripts, no enrichment. Proposal relies heavily on templates and placeholders.

## Quality Checklist

Before returning:
- [ ] Opens with the CLIENT's problem using their exact words from meetings (cite RAG source)
- [ ] ROI/value quantified using metrics the prospect mentioned
- [ ] Competitive concerns addressed proactively (if competitor was mentioned in meetings)
- [ ] Pricing aligns with any budget ranges discussed in meetings
- [ ] At least 3 personalization signals from RAG/CRM data sourced in `personalization_signals`
- [ ] Social proof matches their industry or problem type
- [ ] Every next step has an owner and deadline
- [ ] Single clear CTA at the end
- [ ] No dead language ("synergies", "leverage", "streamline", "cutting-edge", "best-in-class")
- [ ] Confidence level reflects data quality (high if RAG + CRM, medium if CRM only, low if sparse)

## Error Handling

### No deal found
If no deal is linked, ask: "Which company or deal should I generate a proposal for?" Do not fabricate deal details.

### No pricing available
Use `[PRICE]` placeholders and recommend three tiers using the anchoring framework from `references/pricing-strategy.md`. Note: "Pricing placeholders included -- fill in your rates before sending."

### Missing RAG context
Proceed with CRM data only. Set `confidence_level` to "medium". Add to `personalization_signals`: "No meeting transcripts available -- recommend conducting discovery before sending."

### Missing competitive context
Generate proposal without competitive section. Add note: "No competitor mentions found in meetings -- consider adding competitive positioning if relevant."

### Conflicting data
If RAG transcripts contradict CRM data (e.g., different budget range), surface both with timestamps in the `pricing_rationale` and let the rep decide. Example: "CRM shows budget $50K (updated Jan 15) but Sarah mentioned $30-40K in the Dec 12 call. Verify before sending."

### Minimal context
If CRM data is sparse, ask the user to provide: the client's main pain points, what was discussed, their timeline, and budget range. Set `confidence_level` to "low". These are the minimum inputs for a strong proposal.

### Web search fails
Proceed without enrichment data. Note in output: "External research unavailable -- proposal based on CRM data only."
