## Research Philosophy

Lead research has one purpose: to give the sales rep an unfair advantage in the conversation.

Not an information dump. Not a data sheet. An advantage. The rep who reads your research should know something about the prospect that the prospect does not expect them to know -- and that knowledge should make the outreach feel relevant, personal, and worth responding to.

Three principles govern every research session:

1. **Intelligence over data.** "They raised Series B" is data. "They raised Series B 3 months ago and are hiring 8 SDRs, which means they are scaling outbound and probably evaluating sales tools right now" is intelligence.

2. **Connection points over completeness.** A research brief that covers every dimension but finds zero personalization hooks is useless. A brief that finds one killer connection point and surfaces it clearly is gold.

3. **Confidence over volume.** Three verified facts beat ten unverified ones. Always note your confidence level and data source.

## Search Query Templates by Phase

### Phase 1: Person Discovery

These queries establish identity and locate the prospect's primary online presence.

**LinkedIn Profile Discovery:**
```
"[Full Name]" "[Company Name]" LinkedIn
"[Full Name]" "[Company Name]" site:linkedin.com
"[Full Name]" [Job Title keywords] "[Company Name]"
```

**Professional Presence:**

## LinkedIn Research Techniques

LinkedIn is the single most valuable research source for B2B lead intelligence. Here is how to extract maximum value systematically.

### Profile Analysis Framework

Read the profile in this order for maximum efficiency:

1. **Headline** (5 seconds): The headline is self-authored and reveals what the person wants to be known for. A headline that says "Helping teams scale revenue" tells you their priority. A headline that says "VP Sales | SaaS | PLG" tells you their identity. Note the difference.

2. **Current Role Duration** (5 seconds): Calculate tenure. Under 6 months = new in role (high receptivity to new ideas, still forming vendor relationships). Over 2 years = established (has existing tools, harder to displace but knows the org well).

3. **About Section** (15 seconds): If they wrote one, it reveals priorities, communication style, and professional values. Look for keywords that match your product's value proposition.

4. **Experience Timeline** (30 seconds): Map the career trajectory:
   - Rapid promotions (every 1-2 years at same company) = high performer, ambitious
   - Lateral moves across functions = broad perspective, systems thinker
   - Long tenures (5+ years per company) = loyalty, stability, risk-averse
   - Frequent moves (under 2 years per role) = restless, may not stay long enough to implement
   - Previous companies = check if any are your customers or competitors' customers

5. **Activity Feed** (30 seconds): Scroll their recent posts and comments:
   - What topics do they post about? These are their professional interests.
   - What do they react to? These are their passive interests.
   - Do they post frequently? Active posters are more receptive to social selling.
   - Have they posted about problems your product solves? This is a direct connection point.

6. **Recommendations** (15 seconds): Scan given and received recommendations for:
   - Skill themes (what are they praised for?)
   - Relationship signals (who recommends them? Are any of those people your customers?)
   - Leadership indicators ("great manager," "built the team from scratch," "drove X result")

### Activity Pattern Analysis

| Pattern | What It Signals | How to Use |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Posts 2-3x per week | Thought leader, values professional brand | Reference a specific post in outreach |
| Comments but rarely posts | Engaged but private, prefers dialogue | Ask a question rather than making a statement |
| Shares company content | Brand ambassador, team player | Compliment the company content, not just the share |
| Posts about industry trends | Strategic thinker, forward-looking | Lead with a trend insight, not a product pitch |
| Posts about team wins | People-first leader, values culture | Reference team accomplishments, not individual achievements |
| No activity in 6+ months | Either very private or low LinkedIn engagement | LinkedIn-based outreach may not be effective; try email |

### Connection Mapping

Check for these connection types, in priority order:

1. **First-degree connections at your company**: Warm intro opportunity. Flag immediately.
2. **Shared group memberships**: Common professional interests. Can reference in outreach.
3. **Shared connections at mutual companies**: Ask mutual connection for context.
4. **Same university or certification**: Alumni connection point.
5. **Connected to your existing customers**: Social proof angle -- "Your colleague [Name] at [Company] uses our product."

## News Analysis Methodology

### Signal Extraction Framework

When analyzing news about a prospect's company, apply this framework to separate actionable intelligence from noise:

**The RICE Framework for News Relevance:**
- **R** (Recency): How recent is this? News from the last 30 days is active intelligence. 30-90 days is context. Beyond 90 days, only include if it was a major event (funding round, acquisition, leadership change).
- **I** (Impact): How significantly does this affect the company's priorities or budget? Funding rounds = high impact. Industry award = low impact.
- **C** (Connection): Does this news create a connection point for outreach? Can you reference it naturally in an email or call?
- **E** (Evidence): Is this from a credible source? Press releases from the company itself are highest credibility. Analyst speculation is lowest.

### News Categories by Actionability

| Category | Actionability | Example | How to Use in Outreach |
|----------|--------------|---------|----------------------|
| Funding | Very High | "$30M Series B led by Accel" | "Congrats on the raise. Companies at your stage often..." |
| Leadership hire | Very High | "Appointed new CTO from Google" | New leader = new tool evaluation. Target the new hire. |
| Product launch | High | "Launched enterprise tier" | "Saw the enterprise launch -- that usually means..." |
| Partnership | High | "Partnered with Salesforce" | "Noticed the Salesforce partnership. How are you handling..." |
| Expansion | High | "Opened London office" | "Expanding to EMEA is exciting. Most teams find..." |
| Acquisition | Very High | "Acquired DataFlow for $50M" | "M&A integration often surfaces new tooling needs..." |
| Layoffs | Medium-High | "Reduced workforce by 15%" | Handle with extreme care. Do NOT lead with this. |
| Award / ranking | Low | "Named to Inc 5000" | Light personalization only. "Congrats on the Inc 5000 listing" as a secondary mention. |

### Layoff News: Special Handling Rules

Layoff news requires delicate treatment. Guidelines:

1. **Never lead outreach with layoff news.** It is insensitive and will backfire.
2. **Do use it internally for timing assessment.** Layoffs = budget tightening = harder sale in the short term.
3. **Exception**: If your product helps companies do more with less (automation, efficiency), you can indirectly reference the challenge without naming the layoffs: "Teams that need to maintain output with leaner headcount often find..."
4. **Wait 30-60 days** after layoff news before outreach. The immediate aftermath is chaotic and no one is evaluating new tools.

## Tech Stack Detection Methods

### Method 1: Job Postings (Highest Reliability)

Job postings are the most honest tech stack signal because companies need candidates who know the actual tools they use.

**What to search:**
```
"[Company Name]" jobs [tool category]
site:[company-domain.com]/careers [technology keywords]
"[Company Name]" site:linkedin.com/jobs [technology keywords]
"[Company Name]" site:greenhouse.io OR site:lever.co
```

**What to extract:**

| Job Posting Section | What It Reveals |
|--------------------|----------------|
| "Requirements" / "Must have" | Current production stack |
| "Nice to have" / "Bonus" | Tools they are considering or migrating to |
| "Experience with [Competitor]" | They use your competitor. Displacement opportunity. |
| "Experience with [Your Product]" | They already use you (expansion) or are evaluating. |
| "We use [tool list]" | Explicit stack declaration. Highest confidence. |

### Method 2: Website Analysis (Medium Reliability)

**Front-end detection:**
- View page source for analytics tags (Google Analytics, Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude)
- Check for chat widgets (Intercom, Drift, Zendesk, Crisp)
- Identify CMS (WordPress, Webflow, Contentful, custom)
- Look for CDN headers (Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS CloudFront)
- Check meta tags for marketing tools (HubSpot tracking, Marketo munchkin)

**Tools**: BuiltWith, Wappalyzer, SimilarTech provide automated detection.

### Method 3: Engineering Blog / Conference Talks (High Reliability)

Many companies publish their architecture decisions publicly:
```
"[Company Name]" engineering blog
"[Company Name]" "tech stack" OR architecture
"[Company Name]" speaker [conference name: QCon, KubeCon, re:Invent, etc.]
```

These are high-reliability sources because engineers choose what to share and typically describe actual production systems.

### Method 4: Integration Ecosystem (Medium Reliability)

If the company is a SaaS product, check their integrations page:
```
site:[company-domain.com] integrations OR partners
```

The tools they integrate with are often the tools their customers (and they themselves) use.

### Method 5: GitHub (Medium-High Reliability)

For engineering-forward companies:
```
site:github.com "[Company Name]" OR [company-github-org]
```

Check their open-source repos for language choices, frameworks, and tooling.

### Confidence Levels by Detection Method

| Method | Confidence | Freshness | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Job posting (explicit mention) | Very High | Current | Most reliable single source |
| Engineering blog | High | Varies (check date) | May describe aspirational, not current |
| GitHub repos | High | Check last commit date | Open source may not represent internal stack |
| Website source analysis | Medium | Current | Only detects front-end and marketing tools |
| BuiltWith / Wappalyzer | Medium | Current | Good for web technologies, misses internal tools |
| Integration page | Medium | May be outdated | Shows capabilities, not necessarily usage |
| Conference talk | Medium-High | Check date | May be 6-12 months old by the time it is published |

## Hiring Signal Interpretation Guide

### Hiring Volume Analysis

| Signal | What It Means | Sales Implication |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 0-2 open roles | Stable or constrained. Not in growth mode. | Normal timing. No urgency signal from hiring. |
| 3-5 open roles | Moderate growth. Filling specific gaps. | Look at WHAT roles to understand priorities. |
| 6-15 open roles | Active growth. Budget available. Team building. | Good timing. Growing companies evaluate tools. |
| 15-30 open roles | Aggressive scaling. Significant budget. | Strong timing. Scaling creates new pain points your product may address. |
| 30+ open roles | Hyper-growth or replacement cycle. | If net new (not backfills), excellent timing. If backfills after layoffs, be cautious. |

### Role Type Signal Matrix

| Role Being Hired | What It Signals | Your Move |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| VP/Director of [Your Function] | New leader = new tool evaluation within 90 days | Target this hire directly. They will evaluate every tool in the stack. |
| Manager of [Your Function] | Team formalization. Moving from ad hoc to structured. | Building a business case for tools. Good timing. |
| ICs in [Your Function] | Team scaling. Existing tools may not scale with them. | Position product around team scaling challenges. |
| SDRs/BDRs (multiple) | Building outbound motion. Need sales tools. | If you sell sales tools, this is a direct buying signal. |
| Engineers (many) | Product investment. Building, not just maintaining. | May need dev tools, infrastructure, monitoring. |
| "RevOps" or "Sales Ops" | Operationalizing revenue function. Tool consolidation coming. | RevOps hires are tool evaluators by nature. |
| Data Engineer / Analyst | Data infrastructure investment. | May need analytics, BI, data pipeline tools. |
| Security / Compliance | Maturing security posture. May require SOC2/HIPAA from vendors. | Ensure your product meets their likely compliance requirements. |

### Hiring Velocity as a Growth Proxy

Calculate: `(Open roles / Total employees) x 100 = Hiring Rate`

| Hiring Rate | Interpretation |
|-------------|---------------|
| <2% | Maintenance hiring. Not a growth signal. |
| 2-5% | Normal growth. Steady state. |
| 5-10% | Active growth. Budget is flowing. |
| 10-20% | Aggressive growth. Likely recently funded. |
| >20% | Hyper-growth. May be post-funding sprint. |

## Time-Boxed Research Protocols

### 5-Minute Quick Research

**When to use**: High-volume qualification, initial triage, leads where you need a fast yes/no/maybe.

**Protocol:**
1. (1 min) LinkedIn profile scan: current title, company, headline, tenure
2. (1 min) Company LinkedIn page: size, industry, headquarters, growth trend
3. (1 min) Quick Google: "[Company Name] funding news" -- check for recent funding or major news
4. (1 min) Company website: About page scan, pricing page existence check
5. (1 min) Synthesize: Write 3-sentence summary with one connection point

**Expected output**: Name, title, company, size, industry, one recent signal, one connection point, confidence level.

**Confidence level**: Low to Medium. Sufficient for initial scoring, not for personalized outreach.

### 15-Minute Standard Research

**When to use**: Leads that passed initial qualification. Need enough intelligence for personalized first-touch outreach.

**Protocol:**
1. (3 min) LinkedIn deep dive: full profile analysis using the framework above, activity scan, connection check
2. (3 min) Company research: Crunchbase or company website for funding, size, product, business model
3. (3 min) News search: last 90 days of company news, filtered for high-signal events
4. (2 min) Tech stack check: job postings scan for technology mentions, website source quick check
5. (2 min) Connection point identification: find 2-3 potential hooks for outreach
6. (2 min) Synthesize: structured output with lead profile, company overview, connection points

**Expected output**: Full lead profile, company overview, 2-3 connection points ranked by tier, 1-2 news items, basic tech stack, data freshness note.

**Confidence level**: Medium to High. Sufficient for personalized outreach.

### 30-Minute Deep Dive

**When to use**: High-value target accounts, enterprise prospects, competitive deals where you need every edge.

**Protocol:**
1. (5 min) LinkedIn comprehensive: full profile, activity analysis, connection mapping, content topic extraction
2. (5 min) Career trajectory mapping: previous companies, pattern analysis, potential competitor/customer connections
3. (5 min) Company deep dive: Crunchbase, PitchBook (if available), financial health assessment
4. (5 min) News and content analysis: last 6 months of news, blog posts, press releases, conference mentions
5. (3 min) Tech stack full analysis: job postings, engineering blog, website analysis, BuiltWith
6. (3 min) Competitive landscape: who else they might be evaluating, current vendor relationships
7. (2 min) Hiring signal analysis: role types, velocity, specific job descriptions for intel
8. (2 min) Connection point deep search: mutual connections, shared experiences, content alignment

**Expected output**: Comprehensive intelligence brief with all output fields populated, 3-5 ranked connection points, competitive context, hiring analysis, and confidence-rated data freshness.

**Confidence level**: High. Suitable for enterprise deal strategy, not just outreach.

## Identity Verification Techniques

Name collisions are common. Before building a research profile, confirm you have the right person.

### Cross-Reference Checklist

Verify at least 3 of these 5 signals match:

1. **Company match**: The LinkedIn profile shows current employment at the expected company
2. **Title match**: The role aligns with what you expect (or was expected)
3. **Location match**: Geographic location is consistent with the company's offices
4. **Timeline match**: Start date at the company aligns with when the lead was created or the event occurred
5. **Email domain match**: If you have their email, the domain matches the company

### Disambiguation Strategies

| Scenario | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Common name, same company | Cross-reference title, department, and location. Check if the email domain matches. |
| Common name, different companies | Use the company name as primary filter. Verify with location and industry. |
| Multiple LinkedIn profiles | Look for the one with the most connections, most recent activity, and photo consistency. |
| Name variant (Robert vs. Bob, William vs. Bill) | Search for both variants. LinkedIn search handles some aliases automatically. |
| Person recently changed companies | Their LinkedIn may show the new company. Check the date of your lead data against their career timeline. |

## Research Output Quality Standards

### The "Rep Test"

Before delivering research, apply this test: If a sales rep reads this in 60 seconds, can they:

1. Confidently identify who this person is and what they do?
2. Name one specific thing to reference in outreach?
3. Understand whether the timing is good or bad?
4. Know what to ask on a first call?

If the answer to any of these is "no," the research is not done.

### Minimum Quality Bar

Every research output must include:

- [ ] Verified identity (not a name collision)
- [ ] Current title and company (confirmed within last 3 months)
- [ ] At least one connection point (Tier 1 or Tier 2)
- [ ] Company size and industry
- [ ] One recent signal (news, hiring, funding, or engagement)
- [ ] Explicit notation of what could NOT be found
- [ ] Data freshness date
- [ ] Confidence level

## Common Research Pitfalls

### 1. Spending Too Long on Low-Value Leads
**Fix**: Use the 5-minute protocol for initial triage. Only invest 15-30 minutes on leads that pass first-pass qualification.

### 2. Researching the Company but Not the Person
**Fix**: Spend 60% of research time on the person, 40% on the company. The rep connects with a human, not a logo.

### 3. Collecting Data Without Extracting Intelligence
**Fix**: For every fact you find, ask "So what? What does this mean for outreach?" If you cannot answer, the fact is not worth including.

### 4. Presenting Stale Data as Current
**Fix**: Always note when data was last updated. A 2-year-old funding round is context, not a current signal. Label it accordingly.

### 5. Assuming LinkedIn is Complete
**Fix**: LinkedIn is self-reported and often incomplete. People forget to update titles, change companies without updating, and omit past roles. Cross-reference with company website and other sources.

### 6. Ignoring Negative Signals
**Fix**: Negative signals are as valuable as positive ones. "Company had layoffs 2 months ago" is critical intelligence that should affect timing and approach, not something to omit because it is unflattering.

### 7. Name Collision Blindness
**Fix**: Always verify identity with at least 3 cross-reference points. The cost of researching the wrong "John Smith" is not just wasted time -- it is embarrassing outreach.

### 8. Over-Researching Before Qualifying
**Fix**: Research depth should match lead tier. Do not spend 30 minutes researching a lead that has not passed basic qualification. Run lead-qualification first, then research at the appropriate depth for the tier.
