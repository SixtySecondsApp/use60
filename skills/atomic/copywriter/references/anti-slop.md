## AI-Generated Copy Tells

Patterns that make copy feel machine-generated. Avoid all of them.

### 1. Uniform Sentence Length
**AI does:** Every sentence is 12-18 words. Consistent rhythm throughout.
**Humans do:** Long sentence explaining something complex. Then short. A question? Then a fragment for emphasis.

**Fix:** After writing, deliberately vary. Add a two-word sentence. Then a question. Then a longer one that builds.

### 2. Stacked Adjectives
**AI does:** "Our powerful, intuitive, comprehensive platform..."
**Humans do:** "It does [specific thing]." One adjective max, and only if it adds real information.

**Fix:** Delete all adjective stacks. Replace with a specific benefit or result.

### 3. The "Whether You're..." Opening
**AI does:** "Whether you're a startup founder or an enterprise CEO..."
**Humans do:** Pick ONE audience and write specifically for them.

**Fix:** If your copy works for "everyone," it works for no one. Pick the primary audience and speak directly to them.

### 4. Perfect Grammar Everywhere
**AI does:** Flawless prose, proper semicolons, no fragments.
**Humans do:** Start sentences with "And." Use dashes. Write fragments. On purpose.

**Fix:** Introduce deliberate imperfection. Fragments. Starting with conjunctions. Parenthetical asides.

### 5. The Listicle Structure with Emoji
**AI does:** "Key benefits: Point 1. Point 2. Point 3." with identical formatting.
**Humans do:** Vary the presentation. Maybe a story for one, a stat for another, a question for the third.

### 6. Em Dashes Everywhere
**AI does:** "Our platform — which integrates with your CRM — makes it easy to — you guessed it — close more deals."
**Humans do:** Use periods. Short sentences. Em dashes are the single biggest AI tell in 2025.

**Fix:** Every time you're about to use an em dash, make it two sentences instead.

### 7. "I'd Love To" / "I'm Excited To"
**AI does:** "I'd love to share how our platform can help your team."
**Humans do:** "Here's what it does." or "Want to see it?"

### 8. Excessive Hedging
**AI does:** "This could potentially help you possibly achieve better results."
**Humans do:** "This doubles your close rate." Be direct.

### 9. The Fake Personal Touch
**AI does:** "As someone who values innovation..." or "Like you, we believe in..."
**Humans do:** Reference something specific and real about the reader.

### 10. Oxford Commas in Casual Copy
**AI does:** "Sales, marketing, and operations" (always with the oxford comma)
**Humans do:** "Sales, marketing and ops" (dropped in conversational writing)

**Note:** Oxford commas are fine in formal/educational copy. They're an AI tell in casual/email/social copy.

## The Specificity Test

Before finalizing any copy, run every key claim through this test:

| Vague (Fail) | Specific (Pass) |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "Save time" | "Save 6 hours per week" |
| "Increase revenue" | "Add $47K to your pipeline in 90 days" |
| "Better insights" | "Know which 3 deals need attention today" |
| "Many companies trust us" | "4,200 sales teams use 60" |
| "Improved efficiency" | "Cut meeting prep from 30 minutes to 30 seconds" |
| "Great customer support" | "Average response time: 4 minutes" |
| "Easy to use" | "Set up in 4 minutes. No training required." |
| "Comprehensive solution" | "Meeting AI + Pipeline scoring + Auto follow-ups in one tool" |
| "Industry-leading" | "3.2x more accurate than rep forecasts (200-company study)" |
| "Fast results" | "See your first win within 7 days" |

**Rule:** If you can't make it specific, you don't know enough about the product. Go back to research.

## The So-What Test

After every sentence, ask "So what?" If you can't answer with a benefit, rewrite.

**Example:**
- "We use AI to analyze meetings." → So what? → "So you know exactly what to say in your next call to close the deal."
- "Our platform integrates with Salesforce." → So what? → "So your CRM is always up-to-date without your reps touching it."
- "We have 14 health score indicators." → So what? → "So you know which deals are about to slip before your rep does."

Keep asking "So what?" until you reach something the reader emotionally cares about. That's your copy.

## The Coffee Shop Test

Read your copy out loud. Ask: "Would I say this to someone at a coffee shop?"

- "We leverage cutting-edge AI to optimize your revenue operations." → No.
- "Our AI tells you which deals are going to close and which ones need help." → Yes.

- "Seamlessly integrate with your existing workflow ecosystem." → No.
- "It plugs into the tools you already use." → Yes.

- "Empower your team to achieve transformative results." → No.
- "Your team closes more deals. That's it." → Yes.

If it doesn't pass the coffee shop test, rewrite it until it does.
