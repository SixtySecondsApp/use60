## Landing Pages

### Section-by-Section Structure

- Optional: social proof snippet ("Trusted by 10,000+ teams" or logo bar)

**2. Problem Section**
- Name 2-3 specific pain points using audience language
- Use PAS or agitation copy

## Facebook / Meta Ads

### Character Limits (2025)
| Element | Max | Recommended |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Primary text | 3,000 | Hook in first 125 chars (before "See More") |
| Headline | 255 | 40 characters |
| Link description | 255 | 25 characters |
| Carousel headline | 40 | 32 characters per card |
| Carousel description | 20 | 18 characters per card |

### Structure
```
[Hook — must land before 125 chars]

[1-2 lines of body — benefit, proof, or curiosity]

[CTA line]
```

### Rules
- Hook MUST land before the "See More" truncation (125 chars)
- 1-3 lines of primary text perform best
- Lead with pain point, benefit, or question — never "We are proud to..."
- Social proof in the ad body: "Join 50,000+ marketers" or "Rated 4.9/5"
- Headlines: verb-first, benefit-driven. "Cut Meeting Prep to 30 Seconds"
- Test 3-5 ad variants minimum per campaign

### Example
```
Primary: Your reps spend 3 hours/day on data entry. That's 15 hours/week NOT selling.

60 eliminates manual CRM work entirely. Every call, email, and meeting — logged automatically.

Start free. See results this week.

Headline: Stop Wasting 15 Hours/Week
Link Description: Free Trial — No Card Required
```

## Google Search Ads

### Character Limits
| Element | Max |
|---------|-----|
| Headline | 30 characters (up to 15 headlines) |
| Description | 90 characters (up to 4 descriptions) |
| Display path | 15 characters x 2 |

### Rules
- Include primary keyword in Headline 1
- Front-load benefits in descriptions
- Use numbers and specifics: "40% More Deals" not "Better Results"
- Include a CTA in at least one description: "Start Free Trial Today"
- Test responsive search ads with 8-10 headline variations
- Display path should reinforce the value prop: `/free-trial` or `/pipeline-intelligence`

### Example
```
H1: AI Pipeline Intelligence    (24 chars)
H2: Close 40% More Deals       (21 chars)
H3: Free 14-Day Trial          (18 chars)
H4: Trusted by 10,000 Teams    (24 chars)

D1: Stop guessing which deals will close. 60 scores every deal on 14 health indicators. (87 chars)
D2: AI meeting prep, auto follow-ups, and pipeline scoring. Set up in 4 minutes. Try free. (89 chars)
```

## LinkedIn Ads

### Character Limits
| Element | Max | Recommended |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Intro/body text | 600 | 150 chars (truncates at ~140 with "See More") |
| Headline | 200 | 70 characters |
| Description | 300 | Under 100 characters |

### Rules
- Professional but human — LinkedIn audiences reject overly casual
- Lead with a data point or insight, not a product pitch
- Hook must land before the 140-char truncation
- Headlines should feel like a LinkedIn post, not an ad
- Thought leadership angle outperforms product-first messaging

### Example
```
Intro: 73% of sales teams can't predict which deals will close this quarter. The problem isn't effort — it's data.

Headline: See Which Deals Will Actually Close
Description: AI pipeline intelligence. Free trial.
```

## LinkedIn Posts (Organic)

### Structure
```
[Hook — first 1-2 lines, before "...see more"]

[2-3 short paragraphs or a story]

[Key insight or framework — often bulleted]

[Closing thought or call-to-engage]

[3-5 hashtags maximum]
```

### Rules
- 1,300 characters is the sweet spot
- Line breaks between EVERY 1-2 sentences (mobile readability)
- Hook must be strong enough to earn the "...see more" click
- Write in first person — "I" not "we" or "companies"
- No links in the post body (kills reach). Put links in first comment.
- Carousels get 1.9x engagement. Polls get 2.0x.
- 2-3 high-quality posts per week. Consistency > volume.
- Longer comments (15+ words) drive 2.5x more engagement than reactions

### Post Type Templates

**Insight Post:**
```
[Surprising data point or contrarian take]

[Context — why this matters]

[3-5 bullet lessons]

[Closing question to drive comments]
```

**Story Post:**
```
[Hook — the moment of tension]

[The story (3-5 short paragraphs)]

[The lesson]

[Ask: "Has this happened to you?"]
```

**Framework Post:**
```
[Name the problem]

[Introduce your framework/method]

[3-5 steps with one line each]

[Invite people to try it: "Save this for your next..."]
```

## Blog Articles / Long-Form Content

### Structure
- **Headline:** Promise + specificity
- **Introduction:** Hook, context, promise of what the reader will learn (under 150 words)
- **Body:** Organized with H2 every 250-300 words. Scannable. Examples throughout.
- **Conclusion:** Summarize 3 key takeaways. Clear next step or CTA.

### Rules

- 800-1,200 for quick reads and newsletters
- H2 every 250-300 words (scanners read headers first)
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences). Dense paragraphs kill engagement.
- Use bullets and numbered lists for any series of 3+ items
- Bold key phrases for scanners
- One image or visual per 500 words minimum
- Internal links to related content (3-5 per article)
- External links to sources (builds E-E-A-T)

### SEO Rules
- Primary keyword in: title, H1, first 100 words, one H2, meta description, URL slug
- Use primary keyword 2-5 times depending on length (natural, never forced)
- Semantic variations and related terms throughout
- Meta description: 150-160 characters with CTA
- Meta title: under 60 characters, keyword toward the beginning

## Video Scripts

### The 3-Second Rule
Your hook must deliver its core message within 2-3 seconds. Platforms measure "intro retention" — 65%+ 3-second retention gets 4-7x more impressions.

### Script Structure (4-Part)
1. **Cold Open (0-3 sec):** Immediate hook. No introductions, no logos, no "Hey guys."
2. **Setup (3-15 sec):** Context and stakes. Why should the viewer care?
3. **Body (15 sec to end):** Value delivery with "micro-loops" — each section ends with a curiosity gap pulling the viewer forward.
4. **Payoff + CTA (final 3-5 sec):** Deliver on the promise. Direct to action.

### Platform-Specific
| Platform | Optimal Length | Hook Window | Pacing |
|----------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| TikTok | 15-30 sec | 2 seconds | 20% higher energy, trending sounds |
| Instagram Reels | 15-30 sec | 3 seconds | Polished aesthetics, on-screen text |
| YouTube Shorts | 30-60 sec | 3 seconds | Higher info density OK |
| YouTube Long-form | 8-15 min | 15-30 seconds | Multi-hook structure throughout |
| Video Sales Letter | 5-20 min | 15 seconds | PASTOR framework adapted to video |

### Pacing
- ~75 words per 30 seconds at natural speaking pace
- ~150 words per minute
- Shorter videos achieve higher completion rates (the key ranking factor)

### Hook Types
| Type | Example | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| Bold Statement | "Everything you've been told about pipeline is wrong." | Educational, myth-busting |
| Curiosity Gap | "I discovered something about deal velocity that changed everything." | Story-driven |
| Question | "Why do 90% of sales teams fail at forecasting?" | How-to content |
| Result/Proof | "We went from 20% close rate to 48% using one strategy." | Case studies |
| Pattern Interrupt | Unexpected visual or statement that breaks scroll behavior | Short-form |

## Email Marketing (NOT cold outreach — use sales-sequence for that)

### Subject Lines
- Under 50 characters
- Preview text (80-100 chars) reinforces, doesn't repeat
- Personalization increases opens 26%
- A/B test every send

### Body Structure
- Opening line continues the subject line's promise
- One idea per email
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Single CTA, repeated if long
- P.S. line is the second most-read element after the subject line
- Conversational tone — write to one person

### Sequence Architecture
| Sequence | Emails | Cadence | Goal |
|----------|--------|---------|------|
| Welcome | 5-7 | Daily x3, then every 2-3 days | Onboard, build trust, first conversion |
| Nurture | 6-12 | Weekly or bi-weekly | Educate, build authority |
| Cart Abandon | 3-4 | 1hr, 24hr, 48hr, 72hr | Recover purchase |
| Re-engagement | 3-5 | Every 3-5 days | Win back inactive subscribers |
| Launch | 5-8 | Daily during launch window | Convert during limited window |
| Post-Purchase | 3-5 | Day 1, 3, 7, 14, 30 | Retain, upsell, get reviews |

## Product Descriptions

### Structure
1. **Headline:** Benefit in under 10 words
2. **Hook paragraph:** 1-2 sentences — who it's for and what it does for them
3. **Key benefits:** 3-5 bullets, each starting with a verb
4. **Social proof:** One testimonial or metric
5. **CTA:** Clear next step

### Rules
- Benefits before features. Always.
- Use sensory language when possible
- Include the "compared to what?" — how is this better than alternatives?
- One paragraph per benefit. Short.
- If it's e-commerce: price justification near the CTA
