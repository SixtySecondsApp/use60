## Action Scoring Reference

Every action is scored on three dimensions. These scores determine priority ranking.

| Dimension | Score | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| **Impact** | 5 | Directly creates commitment or removes a blocker |
| | 4 | Builds significant momentum toward close |
| | 3 | Maintains engagement and advances understanding |
| | 2 | Administrative or preparatory |
| | 1 | Low-value, maintenance activity |
| **Urgency** | 5 | Window closing within 48 hours |
| | 4 | Overdue or time-sensitive (14+ day gap, approaching deadline) |
| | 3 | Should happen this week |
| | 2 | Important but not time-critical |
| | 1 | Can wait without consequence |
| **Effort (inverted)** | 5 | Under 15 minutes |
| | 4 | 15-30 minutes |
| | 3 | 30-60 minutes |
| | 2 | 1-3 hours |
| | 1 | Half-day or more |

**Priority Score = Impact x Urgency x Effort**
- 75-125: Urgent (do today)
- 40-74: High (do this week)
- 15-39: Medium (schedule for next week)
- 1-14: Low (batch or delegate)

## Discovery Stage Actions

### A-D1: Multi-Thread Into the Account

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | meeting / email |
| Impact | 5 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 3 (30-45 min research + outreach) |
| Priority Score | 45 (High) |

**When to use**: Only 1 contact is engaged. Single-threaded deals close at 5.4% vs. 17% for multi-threaded (Gong Labs).

**Template**:
```
Hi [Champion],

Thanks for the conversation on [topic]. To make sure we address
everyone's priorities, it would help to connect with [role].

Would you be open to introducing me to [specific name if known],
or would it be easier to include them in our next call?
```

**Success indicator**: Second stakeholder agrees to a meeting or call.

---

### A-D2: Quantify the Pain

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | research / meeting |
| Impact | 5 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 3 (30-60 min to build model) |
| Priority Score | 45 (High) |

**When to use**: The buyer has described a problem but has not attached a dollar value. Without quantification, there is no budget justification and no urgency.

**Template approach**: Use the "cost of inaction" framework:
1. How many people are affected?
2. How many hours per week do they lose?
3. What is the loaded cost per hour?
4. What is the annual cost? Monthly?
5. What is the revenue impact (if applicable)?

**Success indicator**: Buyer confirms or adjusts the dollar figure. The number now exists in the conversation.

---

### A-D3: Map the Buying Process

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | call / meeting |
| Impact | 4 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 5 (10 min during a call) |
| Priority Score | 60 (High) |

**When to use**: You do not know how this company buys. This single question -- "Walk me through how your company evaluates and purchases solutions like this" -- accelerates deals by 12% (Corporate Visions research).

**Success indicator**: You can write down the steps from "we want this" to "contract signed" for this buyer.

---

### A-D4: Send Meeting Recap with Insight

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | email |
| Impact | 3 |
| Default Urgency | 4 (must send within 24 hours) |
| Effort | 4 (15-20 min) |
| Priority Score | 48 (High) |

**When to use**: Within 24 hours of any discovery call. Non-negotiable for deal momentum.

**Template**:
```
[Name],

Great conversation today. Here's what I took away:

1. [Their pain, in their words]
2. [The impact you discussed]
3. [The timeline or urgency factor]

One thing I wanted to add: [an insight they did not have --
a data point, a competitor trend, a customer story].

Next step: [specific action with date]

Talk soon.
```

**Success indicator**: Buyer confirms the recap or corrects it (both are good -- engagement is the goal).

---

### A-D5: Confirm BANT/MEDDIC Criteria

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | call / meeting |
| Impact | 4 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 5 (10 min structured questions during a call) |
| Priority Score | 60 (High) |

**When to use**: Discovery call happened but you cannot answer: Is there budget? Who decides? Is the pain real? Is there a timeline?

**Key questions**:
- Budget: "Has budget been allocated for this, or will you need to request it?"
- Authority: "Who else needs to be involved in the final decision?"
- Need: "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is solving this?"
- Timeline: "Is there a specific date by which you need this in place?"

---

## Evaluation Stage Actions

### A-E1: Deliver a Customized Demo

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | demo / meeting |
| Impact | 5 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 2 (1-3 hours preparation) |
| Priority Score | 30 (Medium) |

**When to use**: Buyer has expressed interest and is ready to see the solution. Generic demos close at 20% vs. 45% for customized demos (Consensus benchmark data).

**Customization checklist**:
- [ ] Use the buyer's industry terminology, not yours
- [ ] Build the demo around their specific use case (from discovery)
- [ ] Include their data or realistic substitute data
- [ ] Address their top 3 concerns from discovery
- [ ] Have the competitor differentiation ready (do not bring it up first, but be prepared)

**Success indicator**: Buyer says "this solves our problem" or asks about pricing/next steps.

---

### A-E2: Introduce a Reference Customer

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | reference_call |
| Impact | 5 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 4 (15-30 min to arrange) |
| Priority Score | 60 (High) |

**When to use**: After the demo, before the proposal. Peer validation is the #1 trust accelerator. Time it for maximum impact: when the buyer is interested but not yet committed.

**Reference matching priority**:
1. Same industry + same use case (best)
2. Same industry + different use case (good)
3. Different industry + same use case (acceptable)
4. Same company size (helpful supplement)

**Success indicator**: Buyer confirms the reference addressed their top concern.

---

### A-E3: Create the ROI Model / Business Case

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | research / task |
| Impact | 5 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 2 (1-2 hours) |
| Priority Score | 30 (Medium) |

**When to use**: Economic buyer has not been engaged, or the deal needs budget justification. Deals without a business case close at 12% vs. 38% with one (Gartner).

**ROI model components**:
1. Current cost of the problem (annual)
2. Implementation cost (one-time)
3. Ongoing cost (annual subscription/maintenance)
4. Time to value (when savings begin)
5. 3-year net value
6. Payback period
7. Risk-adjusted return (conservative / expected / optimistic)

---

### A-E4: Engage the Economic Buyer

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | meeting / email |
| Impact | 4 |
| Default Urgency | 4 (if past evaluation midpoint without EB engagement) |
| Effort | 4 (15-30 min to prepare and send request) |
| Priority Score | 64 (High) |

**When to use**: All conversations have been with evaluators. The economic buyer has not been in any meeting or received any direct communication. Deals without EB engagement by the midpoint of evaluation close at 11% vs. 34% (MEDDIC benchmarks).

**Template**:
```
[Champion],

I want to make sure our solution aligns with [Executive Name]'s
priorities for the team this year.

Would it be helpful to schedule a brief executive alignment meeting?
My [VP/CEO] would join to discuss the strategic fit and make sure
we're solving the right problem at the right level.

This usually takes 20-30 minutes and helps accelerate the
evaluation for both sides.
```

---

### A-E5: Address the Competitor

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | research / email |
| Impact | 4 |
| Default Urgency | 4 (if competitor demo is imminent) |
| Effort | 3 (30-60 min preparation) |
| Priority Score | 48 (High) |

**When to use**: Buyer has mentioned evaluating alternatives, or competitive signals are present (new evaluation criteria, pricing pressure, feature comparison requests).

**Rules**:
- Never attack the competitor by name unprompted
- Differentiate on the buyer's criteria, not generic feature lists
- Ask: "What are the top 3 things that matter most in this decision?"
- Position on those 3 things specifically

---

## Proposal Stage Actions

### A-P1: Send the Proposal

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | proposal |
| Impact | 5 |
| Default Urgency | 5 (every day without a proposal is a day the deal can die) |
| Effort | 2 (1-2 hours to prepare) |
| Priority Score | 50 (High) |

**When to use**: Buyer has verbally agreed to move forward. Do NOT wait to "make it perfect." Send it now and iterate. Research shows that proposals sent within 24 hours of verbal agreement close at 2.1x the rate of proposals sent after 72+ hours (Proposify, analysis of 1.4M proposals).

---

### A-P2: Pre-Wire the Negotiation

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | call |
| Impact | 5 |
| Default Urgency | 4 |
| Effort | 5 (10-15 min call) |
| Priority Score | 100 (Urgent) |

**When to use**: Before formal negotiation begins. Call your champion and ask: "What concerns do you think [economic buyer] will have? What would make this a no-brainer?" This prevents surprises and lets you prepare concessions strategically.

**Success indicator**: You know the buyer's likely objections before they raise them.

---

### A-P3: Map Procurement Requirements

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | call / email |
| Impact | 4 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 5 (10 min question during a call) |
| Priority Score | 60 (High) |

**When to use**: Deal is about to enter procurement and you have not asked about the process. Procurement delays are the #1 source of late-stage slippage.

**Key question**: "What does your procurement process look like? Vendor registration, security review, legal review -- what do you need from us and how long does each step take?"

---

## Negotiation Stage Actions

### A-N1: Resolve the Final Objection

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | call |
| Impact | 5 |
| Default Urgency | 5 |
| Effort | 5 (10 min call) |
| Priority Score | 125 (Urgent) |

**When to use**: Contract has been sent, but it is not moving. There is always one last thing. Call your champion: "Is there anything between us and getting this signed this week?"

---

### A-N2: Offer Strategic Concession

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | email / call |
| Impact | 4 |
| Default Urgency | 4 |
| Effort | 4 (15-30 min to prepare) |
| Priority Score | 64 (High) |

**When to use**: Buyer is asking for a discount or additional terms. Have 2-3 concessions ready that cost you little but give the buyer something to "win."

**Concession hierarchy** (from least to most costly):
1. Extended payment terms (Net-60 instead of Net-30)
2. Additional training or onboarding hours
3. Longer pilot or trial period
4. Multi-year discount (locks in revenue)
5. Added features or users (marginal cost is low for SaaS)
6. Price reduction (last resort -- always tie to something: longer term, case study rights, etc.)

---

### A-N3: Create Urgency with a Real Constraint

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | email |
| Impact | 3 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 5 (10 min) |
| Priority Score | 45 (High) |

**When to use**: Deal is drifting without a deadline. Use a real constraint: pricing validity, implementation team availability, or fiscal year alignment. Artificial urgency destroys trust.

**Template**:
```
[Name],

Quick heads-up: our implementation team has capacity starting
[date], but after that our next opening is [later date].

If we can get the contract wrapped up by [date], we can start
right away. Otherwise we're looking at a [X]-week delay on
kickoff.

Wanted to flag it so we can plan accordingly.
```

---

## Closing Stage Actions

### A-C1: Make Signing Frictionless

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | task |
| Impact | 5 |
| Default Urgency | 5 |
| Effort | 5 (10 min) |
| Priority Score | 125 (Urgent) |

**When to use**: Contract is approved, but not signed. Remove every possible friction point.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] E-sign link (not a PDF to print and scan)
- [ ] Pre-filled fields where possible
- [ ] Clear instructions on who signs and where
- [ ] Mobile-friendly signing experience
- [ ] Follow up within 4 hours if not signed same day

---

### A-C2: Preview the Implementation Plan

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | email / meeting |
| Impact | 4 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 3 (30-45 min to prepare) |
| Priority Score | 36 (Medium) |

**When to use**: Buyer is hesitating at the signature stage. Showing what happens AFTER they sign reduces the perceived risk of commitment and makes signing feel like progress.

---

### A-C3: Align on Success Metrics

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | meeting / email |
| Impact | 3 |
| Default Urgency | 2 |
| Effort | 4 (15-20 min) |
| Priority Score | 24 (Medium) |

**When to use**: Before or at signature. Agree on how you will both measure success in the first 90 days. This sets the foundation for renewal and expansion.

---

## Cross-Stage Actions

These actions apply regardless of deal stage.

### A-X1: Value-Add Re-Engagement

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | email |
| Impact | 3 |
| Default Urgency | Varies (4 if 7+ day gap, 5 if 14+ day gap) |
| Effort | 5 (10-15 min) |
| Priority Score | 60-75 depending on gap duration |

**When to use**: No activity in 7+ days. Re-engage with value, NOT "just checking in."

**Template options**:
1. Share a relevant article or report
2. Share a customer result from their industry
3. Share a competitive insight
4. Share a product update relevant to their use case

**Never say**: "Just checking in," "Wanted to touch base," "Following up," "Bumping this." These phrases signal that you have nothing valuable to add.

---

### A-X2: Breakup Email

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | email |
| Impact | 3 |
| Default Urgency | 5 (21+ day gap) |
| Effort | 5 (5 min) |
| Priority Score | 75 (Urgent) |

**When to use**: No response after 21+ days of silence. Paradoxically re-engages 15-20% of stalled deals (Gong Labs).

**Template**:
```
[Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm going to assume the timing
isn't right for [project/initiative].

If things change, I'm here. In the meantime, I'll close this
out on my end.

All the best.
```

**Rule**: Send exactly one breakup email. Never send a second one. If no response, move on.

---

### A-X3: CRM Update & Data Hygiene

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | crm_update |
| Impact | 2 |
| Default Urgency | 2 |
| Effort | 5 (5-10 min) |
| Priority Score | 20 (Medium) |

**When to use**: Deal stage, close date, or value does not match reality. CRM hygiene matters for forecasting accuracy but should never be the top priority action.

---

## Re-Engagement Actions

### By Days Since Last Activity

| Days Silent | Action | Urgency | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7-13 | Value-add email (insight, article, case study) | 4 | Bring something new, do not repeat |
| 14-20 | Direct outreach to champion with specific question | 5 | Phone call preferred, not email |
| 14-20 | Contact a different stakeholder | 5 | Go around if champion is silent |
| 21-30 | Breakup email | 5 | Creates psychological tension |
| 30+ | Mark as at-risk, reassess deal viability | 5 | Is this deal worth saving? |

### By Failed Outreach Pattern

| Pattern | Action | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2+ emails, no response | Switch to phone | Email channel is exhausted |
| 2+ calls, no answer | Try LinkedIn message | Different channel, different attention |
| All channels silent | Go through different stakeholder | Your contact may be unavailable |
| Different stakeholder also silent | Executive-to-executive outreach | Escalation may be needed |
| All contacts silent 21+ days | Breakup email + reassess | Deal may be dead |

---

## Internal Alignment Actions

### A-I1: Manager Briefing

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | internal_alignment |
| Impact | 2 |
| Default Urgency | 2 |
| Effort | 4 (15-20 min) |
| Priority Score | 16 (Low) |

**When to use**: Deal needs executive support, pricing approval, or strategic guidance.

### A-I2: Pre-Call Planning

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | research |
| Impact | 3 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 4 (15-30 min) |
| Priority Score | 36 (Medium) |

**When to use**: Before any important buyer meeting. Research the attendees, prepare questions, anticipate objections.

### A-I3: Solution Engineering Support

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Action Type | internal_alignment |
| Impact | 3 |
| Default Urgency | 3 |
| Effort | 4 (15 min to request) |
| Priority Score | 36 (Medium) |

**When to use**: Technical questions have been raised that the rep cannot answer. Bring in a solutions engineer for the next call.

---

## Action Selection Decision Tree

Use this decision tree when multiple actions could apply. Follow the first matching rule.

```
1. Is the buyer silent (7+ days, no response)?
   YES -> Re-engagement action (A-X1 or A-X2) is the #1 priority
   NO  -> Continue to step 2

2. Is there only 1 contact engaged?
   YES -> Multi-threading (A-D1) is in the top 3 actions
   NO  -> Continue to step 3

3. Is the close date within 2 weeks?
   YES -> Focus on closing actions (A-N1, A-C1, A-C2)
   NO  -> Continue to step 4

4. Is the economic buyer engaged?
   NO  -> A-E4 (Engage Economic Buyer) is the #1 or #2 priority
   YES -> Continue to step 5

5. Does the deal have a business case / ROI model?
   NO  -> A-E3 (Create ROI Model) if past discovery stage
   YES -> Continue to step 6

6. Is there a next meeting scheduled?
   NO  -> Book the next meeting as the minimum viable action
   YES -> Use stage-specific actions for the current stage

7. Are there 10+ open tasks on this deal?
   YES -> Prioritize existing tasks, do not add more
   NO  -> Select stage-appropriate actions
```

**The golden rule**: When in doubt, pick the action that requires the BUYER to do something. Buyer actions create commitment. Seller-only actions create the illusion of progress.
