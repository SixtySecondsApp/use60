## Playbook Overview

Each stage playbook follows the same structure:
- **Objective**: What you are trying to accomplish at this stage
- **Required Actions**: Non-negotiable actions that must happen before the stage is complete
- **Exit Criteria**: Verifiable conditions that must be true before advancing to the next stage
- **Risk Indicators**: Signals that the deal is going sideways at this stage
- **Time Limits**: Maximum acceptable duration before intervention is required
- **Minimum Viable Action**: The single most important thing if you are short on time

### Stage Duration Benchmarks

| Stage | SMB Target | Mid-Market Target | Enterprise Target | Red Flag Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Discovery | 3-5 days | 5-10 days | 1-3 weeks | 2x target |
| Qualification | 3-5 days | 5-10 days | 1-2 weeks | 2x target |
| Demo / Evaluation | 5-10 days | 10-21 days | 3-6 weeks | 2x target |
| Proposal | 3-5 days | 5-10 days | 1-3 weeks | 2x target |
| Negotiation | 3-7 days | 7-14 days | 2-6 weeks | 2x target |
| Closing | 1-3 days | 3-7 days | 1-3 weeks | 2x target |

**Data source**: Salesforce State of Sales 2023, Gartner B2B Buying Report, InsightSquared pipeline benchmarks. These are median durations for won deals. Lost deals average 1.6x longer per stage.

## Stage 1: Discovery

### Objective
Determine whether this buyer has a real problem that your solution can solve, with the urgency and budget to act on it. Discovery is qualification -- if the answers do not support a real opportunity, stop here.

### Required Actions

| # | Action | Impact | Time Estimate | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Conduct discovery call with open-ended pain questions | 5 | 30-45 min | Rep |
| 2 | Quantify the pain in dollars or hours | 5 | 15-30 min | Rep + Buyer |
| 3 | Identify at least 2 stakeholders by name | 4 | During call | Rep |
| 4 | Document the buying process | 4 | 5-10 min | Rep |
| 5 | Send meeting recap with insight within 24 hours | 3 | 15-20 min | Rep |

### Exit Criteria

All of these must be true before moving to Qualification:

- [ ] The buyer articulated a specific pain in their own words (not just agreed with your description)
- [ ] The pain has a financial dimension (costs $X/month, loses Y hours, risks Z revenue)
- [ ] At least one other stakeholder is identified by name (not "someone in IT")
- [ ] The buyer confirmed this is a priority (not "nice to have, maybe next year")
- [ ] A next step is scheduled with a date and time (not "I'll get back to you")

### Risk Indicators

| Signal | Severity | What It Means | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Buyer says "just exploring" | Medium | No urgency, no compelling event | Ask: "What would make this a priority in the next 90 days?" |
| Only one contact engaged | High | Single-threaded from day 1 | Ask for introduction to stakeholder before next call |
| No financial quantification possible | Medium | Pain may not be funded | Share ROI data from similar companies to establish a range |
| Buyer avoids discussing budget | Medium | Budget may not exist | Ask: "Has budget been allocated, or would you need to request it?" |
| No next meeting scheduled after discovery | High | Buyer is not committed | Send recap email with proposed next step and date |

### Time Limit
- **SMB**: 5 business days from first contact. If discovery is not complete in 5 days, the deal is stalling.
- **Mid-Market**: 10 business days.
- **Enterprise**: 15 business days.

**Escalation**: If discovery exceeds the time limit, the deal should be flagged for review. Either re-engage with urgency or deprioritize in favor of active opportunities.

### Minimum Viable Action
Send the meeting recap with insight within 24 hours. This takes 15 minutes and keeps the deal moving. Without it, momentum dies.

---

## Stage 2: Qualification

### Objective
Confirm that this opportunity meets your qualification criteria (BANT, MEDDIC, or your organization's framework). The goal is to decide: invest or disqualify.

### Required Actions

| # | Action | Impact | Time Estimate | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Validate Budget: confirmed or path to approval identified | 5 | During call | Rep |
| 2 | Validate Authority: decision maker(s) identified by name | 5 | During call | Rep |
| 3 | Validate Need: pain is real, funded, and urgent | 5 | During call | Rep |
| 4 | Validate Timeline: compelling event or deadline exists | 4 | During call | Rep |
| 5 | Research the company: size, industry, competitors, recent news | 3 | 20-30 min | Rep |
| 6 | Identify the champion (internal advocate) | 4 | During call | Rep |

### Exit Criteria

- [ ] Budget exists or a clear path to budget approval is documented
- [ ] Decision maker is identified by name and has been mentioned in conversation
- [ ] The need is real: buyer is actively looking to solve this, not just researching
- [ ] A compelling event or deadline drives the timeline (regulation, budget cycle, competitor pressure, executive mandate)
- [ ] The deal fits your ICP (industry, size, use case, geography)
- [ ] A champion has been identified who will advocate for you internally

### MEDDIC Quick Reference

| Letter | Element | Key Question |
|---|---|---|
| M | Metrics | "How will you measure success?" |
| E | Economic Buyer | "Who controls the budget for this?" |
| D | Decision Criteria | "What are the top 3 things that matter in this decision?" |
| D | Decision Process | "Walk me through the steps from 'yes' to signed contract." |
| I | Identify Pain | "What happens if you do nothing for 6 months?" |
| C | Champion | "Who on your team is most excited about solving this?" |

### Risk Indicators

| Signal | Severity | What It Means | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| "We don't have budget yet" | High | May need to build the business case from scratch | Shift to business case building; timeline extends |
| Cannot identify the decision maker | Critical | Deal will stall at proposal stage | Ask directly: "Who signs the contract?" |
| No compelling event | High | Deal will drag without urgency | Help find one: budget cycle, regulation, competitive threat |
| Champion is low-level (IC, not manager+) | Medium | Champion may lack influence | Ask champion to introduce you to their manager |
| Buyer has no evaluation criteria | Medium | Decision will be arbitrary and slow | Help them create criteria (that favor your strengths) |

### Time Limit
- **SMB**: 5 business days. Qualification should be fast for small deals.
- **Mid-Market**: 10 business days.
- **Enterprise**: 15 business days.

### Minimum Viable Action
Confirm the economic buyer by name. Everything else flows from knowing who controls the budget.

---

## Stage 3: Demo / Evaluation

### Objective
Prove that your solution solves their specific problem better than the alternatives. This stage is about building conviction with multiple stakeholders, not just impressing one person.

### Required Actions

| # | Action | Impact | Time Estimate | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Deliver customized demo using buyer's use case | 5 | 1-2 hours prep + 45 min demo | Rep + SE |
| 2 | Engage at least 3 stakeholders | 5 | Ongoing | Rep |
| 3 | Complete technical validation (integration, security) | 4 | 1-4 weeks (enterprise) | SE + Buyer IT |
| 4 | Arrange reference call with peer customer | 5 | 30 min to arrange | Rep |
| 5 | Build ROI model with buyer's actual numbers | 5 | 1-2 hours | Rep |
| 6 | Engage economic buyer directly | 4 | 30-min meeting | Rep + Executive |

### Exit Criteria

- [ ] Demo delivered using the buyer's specific scenarios (not generic)
- [ ] At least 3 stakeholders have directly engaged with your team
- [ ] Technical fit confirmed: integration feasible, security acceptable, performance adequate
- [ ] Reference call completed (or case study reviewed with buyer confirmation)
- [ ] ROI model built with buyer-validated numbers
- [ ] Economic buyer is aware of the initiative and supports it
- [ ] Evaluation criteria documented and your solution scores favorably
- [ ] Buyer agrees to move to proposal

### Risk Indicators

| Signal | Severity | What It Means | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Demo keeps getting postponed | Critical | Buyer is deprioritizing | Ask directly: "Is this still a priority?" |
| Only the champion attends the demo | High | Other stakeholders are not invested | Schedule a separate session for the technical team |
| New evaluation criteria appear late | High | Competitor is influencing the process | Ask: "What prompted these new criteria?" |
| "We need to see more" without specifics | Medium | Buyer is stalling or unsure | Ask: "Specifically, what would you need to see to feel confident?" |
| Technical team raises blockers | Medium-High | May be legitimate or political | Schedule technical deep-dive with your engineer |
| No reference call requested | Low | Either very confident or not serious | Offer proactively: "Would it help to hear from a similar company?" |

### Time Limit
- **SMB**: 10 business days. If evaluation takes longer, the deal is at risk.
- **Mid-Market**: 21 business days (3 weeks).
- **Enterprise**: 6 weeks.

### Minimum Viable Action
Schedule the demo with at least 2 stakeholders in the room. Everything else builds from this event.

---

## Stage 4: Proposal

### Objective
Deliver a proposal that the buyer can say "yes" to without additional back-and-forth. The proposal stage should be SHORT -- the selling happened in evaluation. Now it is about documenting the agreement.

### Required Actions

| # | Action | Impact | Time Estimate | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Send proposal within 48 hours of evaluation completion | 5 | 1-2 hours | Rep |
| 2 | Include 3 pricing tiers with clear differentiation | 4 | Included in proposal | Rep |
| 3 | Pre-wire negotiation with champion | 5 | 15 min call | Rep |
| 4 | Follow up on proposal within 48 hours | 4 | 10 min | Rep |
| 5 | Identify procurement requirements early | 4 | 10 min question | Rep |

### Exit Criteria

- [ ] Proposal delivered and confirmed received
- [ ] Buyer has reviewed the proposal (not just received it)
- [ ] Pricing tier selected (or counterproposal received)
- [ ] No new stakeholders appearing
- [ ] Procurement requirements documented
- [ ] Next step is contract negotiation or signature

### Risk Indicators

| Signal | Severity | What It Means | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Proposal sent but not opened (3+ days) | High | Buyer is not engaged | Call and ask: "Did you get a chance to review?" |
| New stakeholders appear at proposal stage | Critical | Someone with influence was missed | Assess whether this person is a champion or a blocker |
| Request for dramatic discount (30%+) | High | Budget issue or competitor leverage | Ask: "Help me understand the budget constraints" |
| "I need to run this by my boss" | High | Economic buyer was not engaged earlier | Offer executive alignment meeting |
| Radio silence after proposal sent | Critical | Deal may be dead | Follow up in 48 hours, escalate to different contact in 5 days |

### Time Limit
- **SMB**: 5 business days from proposal sent to tier selected.
- **Mid-Market**: 10 business days.
- **Enterprise**: 15 business days (longer if procurement is involved).

### Minimum Viable Action
Send the proposal. Do not wait to perfect it. A good proposal sent today beats a perfect proposal sent next week.

---

## Stage 5: Negotiation

### Objective
Remove every obstacle between "yes" and signature. This is not about convincing -- the buyer already wants to buy. This is about satisfying their internal processes and resolving final commercial terms.

### Required Actions

| # | Action | Impact | Time Estimate | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Resolve commercial terms (pricing, SLA, contract length) | 5 | 30-60 min | Rep |
| 2 | Support legal review (MSA, DPA, security questionnaire) | 4 | 1-4 weeks (enterprise) | Rep + Legal |
| 3 | Complete procurement requirements (vendor registration, PO) | 4 | 1-3 weeks | Buyer + Rep |
| 4 | Have concessions ready (do not give them away unprompted) | 4 | 15 min preparation | Rep |
| 5 | Maintain champion engagement throughout | 3 | Ongoing | Rep |

### Exit Criteria

- [ ] All commercial terms agreed (pricing, length, SLA, payment terms)
- [ ] Legal review complete (or no legal review required)
- [ ] Security questionnaire complete (or not required)
- [ ] Procurement process complete (vendor registered, PO issued)
- [ ] Final approver identified and aligned
- [ ] Contract ready for signature

### Risk Indicators

| Signal | Severity | What It Means | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Legal review expanding in scope | High | May indicate fundamental terms disagreement | Get direct contact between legal teams |
| Champion goes quiet during negotiation | Critical | Champion may have lost internal support | Call champion directly: "Is everything OK on your end?" |
| New requirements from procurement | Medium | Standard but delays timeline | Get the full list upfront, not one at a time |
| "Let me think about it" without next step | High | Buyer is avoiding a decision | Address directly: "What specifically are you weighing?" |
| Competitor mentioned during negotiation | Critical | Buyer may be using you for leverage | Ask: "Are you still evaluating alternatives, or is this about getting the best terms?" |

### Time Limit
- **SMB**: 7 business days.
- **Mid-Market**: 14 business days.
- **Enterprise**: 6 weeks (legal/procurement can be slow).

### Minimum Viable Action
Resolve the one remaining commercial objection. Ask your champion: "What is the one thing standing between us and getting this done?"

---

## Stage 6: Closing

### Objective
Get the contract signed and set up the customer for a successful implementation. Speed is everything -- every day at this stage is a day something can go wrong.

### Required Actions

| # | Action | Impact | Time Estimate | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Send e-sign contract (pre-filled, mobile-friendly) | 5 | 10 min | Rep |
| 2 | Confirm authorized signatory is available | 4 | 5 min | Rep |
| 3 | Follow up within 4 hours if not signed same day | 5 | 5 min | Rep |
| 4 | Share implementation plan preview | 4 | 30 min | Rep + CS |
| 5 | Schedule kickoff meeting before contract is signed | 3 | 10 min | Rep |

### Exit Criteria

- [ ] Contract signed by authorized signatories on both sides
- [ ] Payment received or PO confirmed
- [ ] Implementation kickoff date set
- [ ] Success metrics agreed for first 90 days
- [ ] Customer success team introduced

### Risk Indicators

| Signal | Severity | What It Means | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contract sent but not opened | Critical | Signatory may be unavailable or unaware | Call champion, confirm signatory has it |
| "We need one more meeting" | High | Unresolved concern or new stakeholder | Ask: "What specifically do we need to cover?" |
| Close date pushed for the 2nd time | Critical | Deal may not close this quarter | Honest conversation: "Is there something blocking this?" |
| Champion suddenly unavailable | Critical | Something changed internally | Contact another stakeholder immediately |

### Time Limit
- **SMB**: 3 business days from contract sent to signature.
- **Mid-Market**: 7 business days.
- **Enterprise**: 15 business days (may need board cycle alignment).

### Minimum Viable Action
Send the e-sign link. If it has been sent, follow up by phone within 4 hours.

## Stage Transition Checklist

Before moving a deal to the next stage, verify these minimum requirements:

| Transition | Must Be True |
|---|---|
| Discovery -> Qualification | Pain quantified, at least 1 stakeholder identified, next step scheduled |
| Qualification -> Evaluation | BANT confirmed, champion identified, evaluation criteria agreed |
| Evaluation -> Proposal | Demo completed, 3+ stakeholders engaged, economic buyer aware, technical fit confirmed |
| Proposal -> Negotiation | Proposal reviewed, tier selected, no new blockers, procurement requirements known |
| Negotiation -> Closing | All terms agreed, legal complete, procurement complete, approver aligned |
| Closing -> Won | Contract signed, payment confirmed, kickoff scheduled |

**The premature advancement trap**: Moving a deal to the next stage before exit criteria are met inflates the pipeline and destroys forecast accuracy. A deal in "Proposal" without economic buyer engagement is really still in "Evaluation." Be honest about stage placement.

## Time Limits and Escalation Rules

### Escalation Ladder

| Time Exceeded By | Escalation |
|---|---|
| 25% over stage target | Rep self-diagnoses: what is blocking this deal? |
| 50% over stage target | Manager review: is this deal still viable? |
| 100% over stage target (2x) | Leadership review: rescue, requalify, or close as lost |
| 150% over stage target | Strong recommendation to close as lost unless clear path to close exists |

### The 2x Rule

A deal that has been in any single stage for more than 2x the target duration has a less than 15% chance of closing (InsightSquared analysis of 100,000+ deals). At 2x duration, the deal must either show a clear, verifiable reason for the delay (e.g., board meeting cycle, regulatory review with a known end date) or be closed as lost.

---

## Stage Health Scorecard

Score each deal on these dimensions at every stage. A deal that scores below 50% on any dimension needs intervention.

| Dimension | Weight | How to Score |
|---|---|---|
| Stakeholder engagement | 25% | Number of engaged contacts / number of required contacts |
| Activity recency | 25% | Days since last activity vs. stage target |
| Exit criteria progress | 25% | Criteria met / total criteria for current stage |
| Timeline compliance | 15% | Days in stage / stage target duration |
| Buyer commitment signals | 10% | Next meeting scheduled? Buyer took an action? Shared internal info? |

**Score interpretation**:
- 80-100%: Healthy. Continue current approach.
- 60-79%: Monitor. Address weak dimensions proactively.
- 40-59%: At risk. Create a specific intervention plan.
- Below 40%: Critical. Rescue or disqualify within 5 business days.
