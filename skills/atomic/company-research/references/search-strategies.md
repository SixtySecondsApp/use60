## Industry-Specific Search Patterns

### SaaS / Tech Companies
- `"[Company]" API OR integration OR SDK` — technical footprint

- `site:builtwith.com "[domain]"` — technology profile

### Recruitment / Staffing
- `"[Company]" recruitment OR staffing OR "talent acquisition"`
- `site:glassdoor.com "[Company]"` — employer reputation
- `"[Company]" job postings OR careers` — growth signals

### Financial Services
- `"[Company]" FCA OR "financial conduct authority"` — UK regulation

- `"[Company]" AUM OR "assets under management"` — scale indicators

### E-commerce / Retail

## Data Source Priority

When multiple sources conflict, trust in this order:

1. **Official filings** (Companies House, SEC, regulatory bodies)
2. **Company's own website** (about page, press releases)
3. **Verified review platforms** (G2, Trustpilot with verified badges)
4. **Reputable press** (TechCrunch, Bloomberg, industry publications)
5. **LinkedIn** (employee counts, leadership changes)
6. **Social media** (treat as unverified — useful for signals, not facts)

## Buying Intent Signals

Flag these if found — they're gold for sales teams:

- **Leadership changes**: New CTO/VP Engineering = potential tech stack review
- **Funding round**: Fresh capital = budget for new tools
- **Job postings**: Hiring for roles related to your product = active need
- **Competitor mentions**: Complaints about current vendor = switching intent
- **Conference attendance**: Speaking/sponsoring = active in market
- **Blog content**: Writing about problems your product solves = awareness stage
- **Tech stack changes**: Migrating platforms = evaluation window

## When Data Is Scarce

For companies with minimal online presence:

1. **Check domain WHOIS**: Registration date, registrant (if not private)
2. **Wayback Machine**: `web.archive.org/web/*/[domain]` — see historical versions
3. **Job boards**: Indeed, LinkedIn Jobs — active listings reveal team size and tech
4. **Patent databases**: Google Patents — innovation signals
5. **App stores**: If they have mobile apps, check reviews and update frequency
6. **GitHub**: Open source contributions reveal engineering culture
7. **Court records**: Litigation can reveal business disputes or IP battles
