  Executive Summary

  Sixty Seconds is growing at 20-30% month-on-month. The product is strong, the market is there, and marketing is delivering. But as you put it:
  "If you haven't got great salespeople, the whole thing falls over." Right now, each of your five salespeople sells differently, your CS team
  leaves 30-40% of expansion revenue on the table, and your managers haven't been equipped to coach. This proposal outlines a 12-month
  reinforcement programme that turns your sales operation from a collection of individuals into what you described as "a machine" — a repeatable,
  scalable system that doesn't depend on two or three star performers.

  ---
  The Challenge

  You told us three things that stuck:

  "We're just burning opportunities." Your marketing engine generates strong inbound. But without a structured sales conversation, those leads
  don't convert consistently. Your mid-level reps aren't qualifying properly — one deal consumed 40+ hours across six weeks of meetings, demos, and
   a customised proposal, only to discover you'd been selling to the wrong person the entire time. That's not a one-off. It's a process problem.

  "They leave money on the table." Your three-person CS team is brilliant at service but allergic to selling. There's an estimated 30-40% expansion
   revenue sitting in existing accounts — upsells, cross-sells, new office rollouts — that goes uncaptured because your CS team doesn't see
  themselves as commercial. When opportunities surface, they defer to sales, losing momentum and revenue in the handoff.

  "I can't keep being a player-manager." You're jumping in on every big deal because there's no consistent framework for the team to follow. You
  want to focus on the product, the vision, and partnerships. But until the sales infrastructure can run without you in every pipeline review,
  you're stuck.

  The cost of waiting: Every month without a structured sales process means more 40-hour deals going nowhere, more expansion revenue left
  uncaptured, and more dependency on your two senior performers. With 2-3 new hires arriving by end of Q1, the gap between where you are and where
  you need to be is about to widen.

  Our Approach

  This isn't a one-day workshop. You've tried that — "they came back fired up for a week and then it was back to normal." This is a 12-month
  behaviour-change programme built on the Sandler Selling System.

  The Sandler Success Triangle

  We work on three sides simultaneously — because technique alone doesn't stick:

  - Behaviour — The daily disciplines. Prospecting habits. Pipeline management. The stuff that separates consistent performers from streaky ones.
  - Attitude — Mindset and resilience. How your reps recover when a deal falls through. Right now, setbacks derail your people for weeks. That
  changes.
  - Technique — Qualification frameworks. Structured conversations. Handling objections. Closing without pressure. The skills your CS team needs to
   have commercial conversations confidently.

  New Joiners: As your 2-3 new hires arrive in Q1, they slot into the programme with accelerated catch-up sessions. When you've got two or more
  starting together, we run group sessions — more effective and more efficient.

  Leavers: If someone leaves, we swap them out at no additional cost. You're never paying for a ghost seat.

  The Team

  Berkeley Harris — Your Sandler trainer and coach. Berkeley has worked with growing SaaS and technology businesses through exactly this transition
   — from founder-led sales to scalable sales operations. He'll lead all sessions, coach on live deals, and work directly with you and your
  managers on building coaching capability.

  Backed by Sandler's global methodology team — 250+ offices across 30 countries, refining this system since 1967.

  Proof

  Sandler has been named a Top 20 Sales Training Company for 11 consecutive years by Training Industry. We've trained over 50,000 sales
  professionals globally, including teams at Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, and Splunk.

  Results from companies like yours:

  BuildCentral — a growing tech company — saw 120% revenue growth after implementing the Sandler programme across their sales team.

  One SaaS client improved their close rate from 47% to 85% through proper qualification and structured selling — eliminating the kind of wasted
  40-hour deals you described.

  Symantec trained 1,600 people globally using the Sandler methodology to build consistency across a rapidly scaling sales organisation — the same
  challenge you're solving at a different scale.

  What makes this different from the one-day workshop that didn't work: Reinforcement. We meet your team regularly over 12 months. We coach on real
   deals, not hypothetical scenarios. We measure progress with data, not gut feel. And we build your managers' capability so the methodology
  outlives the programme.

   additional purchase order, no delay.

  Payment: 50% on signing, 50% at Month 6.

  Additional learners can be added at any point during the programme at the same per-person rate (£2,400 + VAT).
