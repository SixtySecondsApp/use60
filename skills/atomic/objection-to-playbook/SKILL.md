# Objection to Playbook Mapper

## Goal
Map sales objections to approved playbook responses with compliance-safe guidance, proof points, and discovery questions. The output should equip a rep to handle the objection confidently in real-time (live conversation) or thoughtfully (email response).

## Objection Handling Philosophy

### Objections Are Buying Signals, Not Rejection

The most important mindset shift in sales: **a prospect who objects is a prospect who is engaged**. A truly uninterested buyer does not push back -- they go silent.

Research supports this:
- **Deals with 2-4 objections** close at a 30% higher rate than deals with zero objections (Gong.io analysis of 1M+ sales calls)
- **Top performers encounter the same number of objections** as average performers -- they just handle them differently (RAIN Group)
- **76% of buyers say** the seller's response to their concern is a primary factor in the purchase decision (Forrester)
- **The #1 mistake** is treating objections as attacks to counter. They are concerns to address.

### The Fundamental Error: Arguing vs. Understanding

Most reps, when faced with "It's too expensive," immediately defend the price. This is wrong. The stated objection is rarely the real objection:

| What They Say | What They Often Mean |
|--------------|---------------------|
| "It's too expensive" | "I don't see enough value to justify the cost" |
| "We're already using [competitor]" | "Switching seems risky and I need justification" |
| "Now isn't the right time" | "This isn't a priority and you haven't made it one" |
| "I need to talk to my team" | "I'm not the decision-maker" or "I'm not sold yet" |
| "We don't have budget" | "We haven't allocated budget because we haven't committed" |
| "It seems too complex" | "I'm worried about implementation disruption" |
| "We tried something like this before" | "We got burned and I need proof this is different" |
| "Send me some information" | "I want to end this conversation politely" |

The skill's job is to identify the **real objection beneath the stated objection** and provide responses that address the root cause.

## The 8 Objection Categories Taxonomy

Every sales objection maps to one of 8 root categories. Accurate classification is essential because the response strategy differs fundamentally for each. See `references/objection-taxonomy.md` for the complete taxonomy with verbatim objection examples, classification decision tree, frequency data, and multi-objection handling guidance.

### 1. PRICE -- "It costs too much"
**Root concern**: Perceived value does not justify the cost.
**Common forms**: "Too expensive," "Over budget," "Competitor is cheaper," "Can't justify the ROI"
**Response strategy**: Shift from cost to value. Quantify the cost of inaction. Reframe around ROI, not price.
**Never do**: Immediately offer a discount (trains the buyer to always negotiate).

### 2. TIMING -- "Not right now"
**Root concern**: Competing priorities or lack of urgency.
**Common forms**: "Call me next quarter," "We're in the middle of [project]," "Too busy right now"
**Response strategy**: Establish urgency through cost-of-delay. Find the trigger event that creates a deadline.
**Never do**: Accept "not now" at face value without exploring what would make it "now."

### 3. COMPETITION -- "We already use / are evaluating [X]"
**Root concern**: Switching cost anxiety or genuine satisfaction with status quo.
**Common forms**: "We use [competitor]," "We're evaluating [competitor]," "Your competitor does X better"
**Response strategy**: Acknowledge the competitor respectfully. Differentiate on specific, relevant dimensions. Ask what they wish was better.
**Never do**: Trash-talk the competitor. It signals insecurity and erodes trust.

### 4. AUTHORITY -- "I need to check with my boss / team"
**Root concern**: Not the decision-maker, or not confident enough to champion internally.
**Common forms**: "I need to run this by [person]," "This is above my pay grade," "My team needs to agree"
**Response strategy**: Equip them as a champion. Provide ammunition (ROI summary, comparison sheet). Offer to join the internal conversation.
**Never do**: Bypass them to go directly to the decision-maker without their consent (destroys trust).

### 5. NEED -- "We don't need this"
**Root concern**: Genuine lack of perceived need or poor discovery.
**Common forms**: "We're fine with what we have," "We don't see the problem," "This isn't a priority"
**Response strategy**: Return to discovery. Ask about pain points. Share how similar companies discovered latent needs.
**Never do**: Argue that they DO need it. Let the questions reveal the gap.

### 6. TRUST -- "I'm not sure about your company"
**Root concern**: Credibility, longevity, or reliability concerns.
**Common forms**: "You're too small," "We haven't heard of you," "What if you go out of business?" "Can you handle our scale?"
**Response strategy**: Lead with proof. Customer logos, case studies, security certifications, uptime stats. Offer a pilot or POC.
**Never do**: Get defensive about company size or age. Acknowledge the concern and let evidence speak.

### 7. COMPLEXITY -- "This seems hard to implement"
**Root concern**: Fear of disruption, change management burden, or integration nightmares.
**Common forms**: "Implementation sounds complex," "How long will migration take?" "Our team won't adopt it"
**Response strategy**: Simplify the picture. Share implementation timelines from similar customers. Offer phased rollout. Highlight support and onboarding.
**Never do**: Minimize genuine complexity. If implementation is hard, be honest about it and show how you support through it.

### 8. STATUS QUO -- "We're fine doing it the way we do"
**Root concern**: Inertia. The pain of change outweighs the perceived pain of staying.
**Common forms**: "We've always done it this way," "Our current process works fine," "If it ain't broke..."
**Response strategy**: Challenge the assumption with data. Show the hidden cost of the status quo. Use peer pressure ("companies like you are moving to...").
**Never do**: Insult their current process. Respect their history while illuminating the future.

## The "Acknowledge-Question-Reframe" (AQR) Methodology

The gold-standard objection handling framework. Three steps, always in this order. Consult `references/response-frameworks.md` for the complete AQR framework with 5 worked examples, plus 7 additional frameworks (Feel-Felt-Found, Cost of Inaction, Social Proof Bridge, Reframe, Champion Enablement, Isolate and Resolve, Graceful Exit) with when-to-use guidance and compliance guardrails.

### Step 1: ACKNOWLEDGE (Build trust, not walls)

Validate the concern. Show you heard them. This disarms defensiveness.

**Acknowledgment templates**:
- "That's a fair concern, and I appreciate you raising it."
- "I hear you -- [restating their concern] is important."
- "You're right to think carefully about this."
- "Several of our customers had that same concern before they started."

**What acknowledgment is NOT**:
- Agreeing the objection is valid ("You're right, we are expensive" -- never concede)
- Dismissing it ("Oh, that's not really an issue" -- invalidates the buyer)
- Panicking ("Oh no, let me get my manager" -- signals weakness)

### Step 2: QUESTION (Understand the real objection)

Ask 1-2 clarifying questions to uncover what is really behind the stated objection. The stated objection is the tip; the real concern is the iceberg.

**Discovery question principles**:
- Open-ended, not yes/no
- Curious, not interrogating
- Focused on their world, not yours
- One question at a time (not a list of 5)

**Discovery question templates by category**:

| Category | Discovery Question |
|----------|-------------------|
| Price | "When you say it's too expensive, are you comparing to a specific alternative, or is it a matter of the overall budget?" |
| Timing | "What would need to change in your situation for this to become a priority?" |
| Competition | "What specifically are you getting from [competitor] that you'd need us to match or exceed?" |
| Authority | "What does your team's evaluation process typically look like for a decision like this?" |
| Need | "Walk me through how your team handles [problem area] today -- what's working and what's not?" |
| Trust | "What would you need to see from us to feel confident we can deliver?" |
| Complexity | "What's been your experience with implementations like this in the past?" |
| Status Quo | "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your current process, what would it be?" |

### Step 3: REFRAME (Shift the perspective)

After understanding the real concern, reframe the conversation. This is not arguing -- it is showing the objection from a different angle.

**Reframe techniques**:

1. **Cost-of-Inaction reframe** (for Price/Timing): "What's the cost of NOT solving this for another 6 months?"
2. **Peer reframe** (for Trust/Status Quo): "Companies like [similar customer] had the same concern. Here's what they found..."
3. **Specificity reframe** (for Competition): "Let me show you specifically where we differ on [their stated priority]..."
4. **Risk-reduction reframe** (for Complexity/Trust): "Here's how we de-risk this -- pilot program, phased rollout, dedicated support..."
5. **Champion-enablement reframe** (for Authority): "Let me put together a one-pager that makes it easy for you to present this internally."

## Response Framework by Objection Type

### Structure for Every Response

```
OPENING (Acknowledge)
  [Validate the concern -- 1-2 sentences]

DISCOVERY (Question)
  [Ask 1-2 clarifying questions]

MAIN RESPONSE (Reframe)
  [Core response -- 3-5 sentences addressing the real concern]

PROOF POINT
  [Specific evidence -- case study, statistic, or customer example]

BRIDGE TO NEXT STEP
  [Transition to continue the conversation productively]
```

### Tone Recommendations by Category

| Category | Recommended Tone | Why |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| Price | Confident, value-focused | Show conviction in the value, not desperation to close |
| Timing | Empathetic, urgency-aware | Respect their timeline while helping them see cost of delay |
| Competition | Respectful, differentiated | Never attack competitors -- elevate your own strengths |
| Authority | Supportive, enabling | Help them be a hero internally |
| Need | Curious, consultative | If they don't need it, better to find out now |
| Trust | Calm, evidence-based | Let data and references do the heavy lifting |
| Complexity | Reassuring, structured | Break the big picture into manageable steps |
| Status Quo | Challenging, peer-informed | Gently disrupt complacency with data |

## Proof Point Selection Methodology

Not all proof points work for all objections. Match evidence to concern:

| Objection Category | Best Proof Point Types | Examples |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Price | ROI calculations, cost-of-inaction studies | "Customers see 3x ROI within 6 months" |
| Timing | Competitor momentum data, cost-of-delay metrics | "Companies that delayed lost 15% market share" |
| Competition | Feature comparisons, migration success stories | "We migrated 200 companies from [competitor] last year" |
| Authority | Executive summaries, board-ready ROI decks | "Here's a one-pager your CFO will find compelling" |
| Need | Industry benchmarks, peer adoption rates | "78% of companies in your space have adopted this approach" |
| Trust | Customer logos, uptime stats, security certs | "We serve [big name], [big name], with 99.9% uptime" |
| Complexity | Implementation timelines, support resources | "Average implementation is 3 weeks with dedicated onboarding" |
| Status Quo | Before/after case studies, industry trend data | "[Similar company] saved 40 hours/month after switching" |

**Proof point requirements**:
- Must be **specific** (not "many customers" but "over 200 customers in FinServ")
- Must be **verifiable** (from published case studies, not invented)
- Must be **relevant** to the prospect's industry/size/use case when possible
- Must be **recent** (prefer data from the last 12 months)

## Compliance Guardrails

### Claims You CAN Make (with evidence)
- Published case study results with customer permission
- Product capabilities that are currently live and documented
- Industry statistics from reputable research firms
- Customer count and logo usage as contractually permitted
- Awards and certifications that are current

### Claims You CANNOT Make
- Guaranteed future results or ROI
- Competitor disparagement or unverified competitive claims
- Product features that are planned but not shipped
- Customer names without logo usage permission
- Security certifications that have expired or are pending
- Pricing guarantees beyond the current proposal

### Organization-Specific Guardrails
- Check `words_to_avoid` from Organization Context
- Check `key_phrases` for approved messaging
- Check `banned_phrases` for compliance restrictions
- Reference competitors and value propositions from Organization Context for battlecard-style responses
- When in doubt, use softer language: "typically" instead of "always," "our customers often see" instead of "you will get"

## When the Objection Is a Disqualifier

Not every objection should be overcome. Some indicate genuine misfit. The courageous (and efficient) move is to acknowledge it.

### Disqualification Signals

| Signal | Assessment Question | If Confirmed |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| "We have no budget and won't for 12+ months" | "Is there any scenario where this could become a budget priority sooner?" | If no, nurture, don't sell. |
| "We're contractually locked with [competitor] for 2 years" | "When does that contract come up for renewal?" | Set a reminder. Disengage now. |
| "We don't have the problem you solve" | "How does your team currently handle [specific pain point]?" | If they genuinely don't have the pain, disqualify gracefully. |
| "Our CEO has mandated [competitor]" | "Is there room for evaluation, or is this decided?" | If decided, respect it. Stay in touch for when it's not. |
| "We're a team of 2 and your minimum is 50 seats" | Verify minimum viability. | If they can't meet minimums, suggest a better-fit alternative. Be helpful. |

**The graceful disqualification**: "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like we might not be the right fit right now. I'd rather be honest about that than waste your time. Can I check back in [timeframe] when [condition] might have changed?"

This builds trust, preserves the relationship, and often creates a future opportunity.

## Live Conversation vs. Email Response Differences

The same objection requires different handling depending on the medium:

### Live Conversation (call, meeting, in-person)

| Principle | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Pause before responding** | 2-3 seconds of silence shows confidence, not panic |
| **Use the AQR framework verbally** | Acknowledge first, ask second, reframe third |
| **Watch for non-verbal cues** | Tone, pace, and body language reveal the real concern |
| **Stay in dialogue** | The goal is a conversation, not a monologue |
| **Don't over-explain** | In live settings, brevity is power. 30 seconds max per response point |
| **Ask permission to respond** | "Would it be helpful if I shared how other customers have approached this?" |

### Email Response

| Principle | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Don't respond immediately** | A thoughtful email beats a reactive one. Respond within 4-24 hours. |
| **Lead with empathy, not defense** | "Thank you for sharing that concern. It's an important one." |
| **Provide structured evidence** | Bullet points, links to case studies, data tables |
| **Include a specific CTA** | Don't just address the objection -- propose a next step |
| **Keep it concise** | Under 200 words. They won't read an essay. |
| **Offer a call** | "Would a 15-minute call be useful to walk through this together?" |

## The "Pause and Ask" Technique

When caught off guard by an objection you did not anticipate:

1. **Pause** (2-3 seconds): Collect your thoughts. Silence is not weakness -- it is composure.
2. **Reflect**: "That's a great point. Let me make sure I understand..."
3. **Ask**: "Can you tell me more about what's driving that concern?"
4. **Buy time if needed**: "I want to give you a thoughtful answer on that. Can I follow up by [tomorrow/after our call] with some specifics?"

This technique prevents the two worst outcomes: (a) blurting out a weak answer, or (b) becoming defensive.

- [ ] At least 2 discovery questions included
- [ ] At least 1 proof point included with source
- [ ] Proof points are specific and verifiable (not generic claims)
- [ ] Tone matches the objection category
- [ ] Email version is under 200 words and self-contained
- [ ] Compliance guardrails applied (no banned phrases, no unverifiable claims)
- [ ] Disqualification criteria included (courage to walk away)
- [ ] Deal context incorporated when deal_id is provided
- [ ] No competitor disparagement in any response content
- [ ] Response is conversational, not scripted (reps need to sound human)
- [ ] Closing includes a specific next step (not "let me know")

## Error Handling

### Objection text is vague or short
If the objection is just "pricing" or "too expensive" with no deal context:
- Classify based on keywords
- Provide the general response framework for that category
- Add a note: "For a more specific response, share the exact words the prospect used and the deal context."

### Deal not found
If `deal_id` is provided but the deal is not in CRM:
- Provide the response without deal context
- Note: "Deal not found in CRM. Response is based on the objection category alone."

### Objection does not fit any category
If the objection is genuinely ambiguous:
- Classify as the closest category with a "Low" confidence
- Provide responses for the top 2 most likely categories
- Recommend the "pause and ask" technique: "This objection is unusual. Ask the prospect to elaborate before responding."

### Multiple objections in one statement
If the prospect raised multiple concerns ("It's too expensive AND we're locked into a contract"):
- Identify the primary objection (usually the first or most emphatic)
- Address primary objection fully
- Acknowledge secondary objection with a lighter response
- Note: "The prospect raised multiple concerns. Address the pricing concern first, then transition to the contract lock-in."

### Sensitive or emotional objection
If the objection involves personal frustration, a past negative experience, or emotional language:
- Increase empathy in the acknowledgment
- Lead with listening, not problem-solving
- Never minimize the emotion: "I can tell this is frustrating" not "It's not that bad"
- Recommend a longer pause and a genuine apology if appropriate

### Organization playbook not found
If no organization-specific playbook data is available:
- Use the general framework and best practices above
- Note: "No organization-specific playbook found. Response uses general best practices."
- Suggest the team create playbook content for common objections
