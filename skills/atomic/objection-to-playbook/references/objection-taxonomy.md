## Taxonomy Overview

Every sales objection maps to one of 8 root categories. Accurate classification is critical because the response strategy differs fundamentally for each.

| Category | Core Fear | Response Strategy | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Price/Budget | "I'll overpay or waste money" | Value quantification, ROI framing, cost-of-inaction | 64% of conversations |
| Timing/Urgency | "I have bigger problems right now" | Create urgency, find the trigger event | 48% of conversations |
| Authority | "I can't or won't decide alone" | Champion enablement, multi-thread | 42% of conversations |
| Need/Fit | "I don't see the problem" | Discovery, peer examples, latent pain reveal | 35% of conversations |
| Competition | "Someone else does this better/cheaper" | Differentiation, switching cost acknowledgment | 31% of conversations |
| Risk/Trust | "You might fail me" | Evidence, proof points, risk reduction | 27% of conversations |
| Status Quo | "Change is harder than staying" | Cost of inaction, peer pressure, incremental path | 24% of conversations |
| Technical | "This won't work with our systems" | Technical proof, implementation plan, phased approach | 19% of conversations |

*Note: Percentages sum to more than 100% because deals typically surface objections from multiple categories. Source: Gong.io analysis of 1M+ sales conversations, 2023.*

## Category 1: Price/Budget

**Root concern**: The perceived value does not justify the cost. The prospect fears overpaying, wasting budget, or being unable to justify the expense internally.

### Verbatim Objections

| What They Say | What They Often Mean | Severity |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| "Your price is 30% higher than [Competitor X]" | "I need help justifying the premium to my CFO" | High |
| "This is over our budget" | "We haven't allocated budget because we haven't committed yet" | Medium |
| "We can't justify the ROI" | "You haven't shown me enough value to make the math work" | High |
| "We need a discount to move forward" | "I want to negotiate -- this is standard procurement" | Medium |
| "That's more than we expected to spend" | "I anchored on a lower number and you didn't set expectations early" | Medium |
| "We're looking at cheaper alternatives" | "Price is a tiebreaker because I don't see enough differentiation" | High |
| "Can you do something on the pricing?" | "I like it but need to show my boss I negotiated" | Low |
| "We'd need to get additional budget approval" | "The price has moved this to a higher approval tier" | Medium |

### Classification Signals

Classify as Price/Budget when the objection contains:
- Dollar amounts, percentages, or budget references
- Competitor pricing comparisons
- Words: "expensive," "costly," "budget," "ROI," "justify," "discount," "afford"
- References to procurement, finance, or CFO involvement

### Real Concern Patterns

| Surface Pattern | Real Concern | Evidence |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| "Too expensive" with no alternatives mentioned | Value gap -- they don't see enough ROI | Most common (70% of price objections) |
| "Too expensive" with competitor comparison | Differentiation gap -- they see options as equivalent | 20% of price objections |
| "Too expensive" from procurement (not the champion) | Negotiation tactic -- they want a win | 10% of price objections |

### Frequency and Impact

- **64% of sales conversations** include at least one pricing objection (Gong.io, 2023)
- **Deals with pricing objections that are handled well** close at the same rate as deals without pricing objections (Gong.io)
- **Discounting reduces win rate**: Deals with discounts over 20% actually close at lower rates than full-price deals (Proposify, 2.6M proposals)
- **The #1 mistake**: Immediately offering a discount. This trains the buyer to always negotiate and signals that the original price was inflated.

---

## Category 2: Timing/Urgency

**Root concern**: Competing priorities make this feel like a low-urgency investment. The prospect does not see a reason to act now.

### Verbatim Objections

| What They Say | What They Often Mean | Severity |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| "Call me next quarter" | "You haven't created enough urgency for me to act now" | High |
| "We're in the middle of a big project right now" | "I'm overwhelmed and adding anything new feels impossible" | Medium |
| "The timing isn't right" | "I don't have a compelling event forcing a decision" | Medium |
| "We just signed a contract with someone else" | "You're too late -- the decision was made" | Critical |
| "We need to wait for [event/quarter/budget cycle]" | "There's a real constraint, but I may also be stalling" | Medium |
| "I'm too busy to evaluate this right now" | "You haven't made it easy enough or valuable enough to prioritize" | Medium |
| "Let's revisit in 6 months" | "I'm politely saying no without closing the door permanently" | High |
| "We have other priorities for this budget cycle" | "This isn't ranked high enough on our internal list" | High |

### Classification Signals

Classify as Timing when the objection contains:
- Time references: "next quarter," "later," "not now," "in 6 months," "next year"
- Project/initiative references: "in the middle of," "focused on," "committed to"
- Calendar/budget cycle references
- Words: "busy," "timing," "priority," "revisit," "postpone," "wait"

### Real Concern Patterns

| Surface Pattern | Real Concern | Likelihood |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| "Not now" + willingness to schedule a future call | Genuine timing constraint | 40% |
| "Not now" + vague future reference | Polite rejection in disguise | 35% |
| "Not now" + reference to a competing project | Real competing priority | 25% |

## Category 3: Authority/Decision Process

**Root concern**: The person you are talking to either cannot make the decision alone, is not the decision-maker, or needs organizational buy-in.

### Verbatim Objections

| What They Say | What They Often Mean | Severity |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| "I need to run this by my boss" | "I'm interested but not empowered to decide" | Medium |
| "Our VP needs to sign off on anything over $X" | "There's an approval process you need to account for" | Low |
| "I need to get buy-in from the team" | "I'm not sure the team will adopt this" | Medium |
| "Let me check with legal/procurement" | "Standard process -- or they're using it as a delay tactic" | Medium |
| "We have a committee that evaluates these things" | "Your sales cycle just got longer and more complex" | High |
| "I can recommend but I can't approve" | "I'm an influencer, not a decision-maker" | Medium |
| "My boss already has a preferred vendor" | "You need to convince someone else, not me" | High |
| "We need to do an internal review first" | "There's a process I can't skip even if I wanted to" | Medium |

### Classification Signals

Classify as Authority when the objection contains:
- References to other people: "my boss," "the team," "committee," "board," "legal"
- Process references: "approval," "sign off," "evaluate," "review"
- Phrases implying lack of autonomy: "I can't decide," "not up to me," "need to check"
- Words: "authority," "approval," "committee," "consensus," "buy-in"

### Real Concern Patterns

| Surface Pattern | Real Concern | Response |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| "Need boss approval" + they're enthusiastic | They want to champion but need ammunition | Equip them: one-pager, ROI summary, competitive comparison |
| "Need boss approval" + they're lukewarm | They're not sold yet and using the boss as a shield | Return to discovery: address their concerns first |
| "Committee evaluates" + clear process description | Genuine organizational process | Map the process, multi-thread, provide materials for each stakeholder |

---

## Category 4: Need/Fit

**Root concern**: The prospect genuinely does not see the problem you solve, or they believe their current approach is sufficient.

### Verbatim Objections

| What They Say | What They Often Mean | Severity |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| "We don't have that problem" | "Either we truly don't, or we don't realize we do" | High |
| "We're fine with what we have" | "The pain isn't acute enough to justify change" | High |
| "I don't see how this applies to us" | "Your pitch wasn't specific enough to our situation" | Medium |
| "Our industry is different" | "You haven't shown me proof from companies like mine" | Medium |
| "We've been doing it this way for years and it works" | "I don't see the gap between current and possible" | High |
| "We already have a solution for this" | "Show me why yours is meaningfully better" | Medium |
| "This seems like a nice-to-have, not a must-have" | "You haven't connected this to a business-critical outcome" | High |
| "I'm not sure our team would use it" | "Adoption risk -- even if I buy it, it might sit unused" | Medium |

### Classification Signals

Classify as Need/Fit when the objection contains:
- Denial of the problem: "don't need," "not a problem," "works fine"
- Satisfaction with current state: "happy with," "already have," "doing fine"
- Relevance questions: "how does this apply," "our industry is different"
- Words: "need," "fit," "apply," "relevant," "use case," "adopt"

---

## Category 5: Competition

**Root concern**: The prospect is evaluating alternatives and either prefers a competitor or is using competitive pressure to negotiate.

### Verbatim Objections

| What They Say | What They Often Mean | Severity |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| "We're already using [Competitor]" | "Switching seems risky. Convince me the disruption is worth it." | High |
| "[Competitor] does X that you don't" | "One feature is influencing my entire evaluation" | Medium |
| "We're evaluating multiple vendors" | "You're in a competitive process -- differentiate or lose" | Medium |
| "Your competitor is half the price" | "I'm using competitor pricing as leverage" or "I genuinely see them as equivalent" | High |
| "[Competitor] has more customers in our industry" | "I feel safer going with the established player" | Medium |
| "We saw a demo of [Competitor] and it looked good" | "You need to be better, not just different" | Medium |
| "Our team already knows [Competitor's] product" | "Switching cost is high because of muscle memory" | High |
| "The analyst report ranked [Competitor] higher" | "Third-party validation matters more than your pitch" | Medium |

### Classification Signals

Classify as Competition when the objection contains:
- Named competitors
- Comparison language: "better," "more," "cheaper," "ranked higher"
- Evaluation language: "evaluating," "comparing," "vendor selection"
- Words: "competitor," "alternative," "versus," "switch," "migration"

### Frequency Data

- **31% of sales conversations** explicitly mention a competitor (Gong.io)
- **Deals with 1-2 competitor mentions** close at similar rates to no-competitor deals
- **Deals with 3+ competitor mentions** have 17% lower close rates (evaluation fatigue)
- **Never trash-talk the competitor**: Negative selling reduces win rate by 24% (Gong.io)

---

## Category 6: Risk/Trust

**Root concern**: The prospect is worried about vendor reliability, company longevity, data security, or the ability to deliver on promises.

### Verbatim Objections

| What They Say | What They Often Mean | Severity |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| "You're too small for a company our size" | "I'm worried about support, scalability, and longevity" | High |
| "We haven't heard of you" | "I can't risk my reputation on an unknown vendor" | Medium |
| "What if you go out of business?" | "I need assurance that my investment is protected" | High |
| "Can you handle our scale?" | "I need proof you've done this before at our volume" | Medium |
| "What are your security certifications?" | "Our compliance team will block this if you can't prove security" | Medium |
| "We got burned by a vendor before" | "I'm risk-averse because of past pain. Prove you're different." | High |
| "How long have you been in business?" | "Age = stability in my mind" | Low |
| "Do you have customers our size?" | "Social proof from peers is the strongest trust signal" | Medium |

### Classification Signals

Classify as Risk/Trust when the objection contains:
- Size/scale concerns: "too small," "handle our volume," "enterprise-ready"
- Longevity concerns: "go out of business," "been around," "established"
- Security/compliance: "certifications," "SOC 2," "GDPR," "data privacy"
- Past negative experience references
- Words: "risk," "trust," "reliable," "proven," "secure," "stable"

---

## Category 7: Status Quo/Inertia

**Root concern**: Change is hard. Even when the prospect agrees there is a problem, the effort of switching feels more painful than living with the current approach.

### Verbatim Objections

| What They Say | What They Often Mean | Severity |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| "We've always done it this way" | "I don't see enough reason to disrupt what's working" | High |
| "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" | "The pain isn't acute enough to justify the disruption" | High |
| "Changing would be too disruptive" | "The transition cost feels higher than the benefit" | High |
| "Our team won't adopt something new" | "Change management is a bigger problem than the tool" | Medium |
| "We tried something like this before and it didn't work" | "I'm scarred by a past failure. Prove this is different." | High |
| "Let's stick with what we know" | "The devil I know is better than the devil I don't" | Medium |
| "It would take too long to switch" | "Transition time is a real cost that you're not acknowledging" | Medium |
| "People are comfortable with the current process" | "The political cost of change outweighs the benefit" | Medium |

### Classification Signals

Classify as Status Quo when the objection contains:
- References to current processes: "the way we do it," "current system," "existing approach"
- Change resistance: "disruptive," "too much work," "won't adopt"
- Past failure references: "tried before," "didn't work," "burned"
- Comfort language: "comfortable," "familiar," "works fine"
- Words: "change," "switch," "transition," "disrupt," "adopt," "migrate"

### Critical Data Point

**40-60% of B2B deals are lost to "no decision"** -- not to a competitor (Matt Dixon, analysis of 2.5M sales calls). Status quo is the most dangerous competitor because it cannot be displaced with features; it can only be displaced with urgency and demonstrated cost of inaction.

---

## Category 8: Technical/Integration

**Root concern**: The prospect fears implementation complexity, integration failures, system incompatibility, or technical limitations.

### Verbatim Objections

| What They Say | What They Often Mean | Severity |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| "Does this integrate with our [system]?" | "If it doesn't, it's a non-starter" | Medium |
| "How long does implementation take?" | "I'm worried about disruption to our current workflow" | Medium |
| "Our tech stack is complex" | "I think this will be a nightmare to deploy" | High |
| "We'd need to involve our engineering team" | "This is going to slow down the process significantly" | Medium |
| "Will this work with [specific technology]?" | "I have a hard requirement that needs to be met" | Medium |
| "Our last integration was a disaster" | "I have PTSD from a bad vendor experience" | High |
| "We need on-premise, not cloud" | "Security/compliance constraints limit our options" | High |
| "What happens to our existing data?" | "Data migration is a major risk in my mind" | Medium |

### Classification Signals

Classify as Technical when the objection contains:
- System/tool names: "Salesforce," "SAP," "our ERP," "our CRM"
- Integration language: "connect," "API," "integrate," "compatible"
- Implementation concerns: "deployment," "migration," "timeline," "engineering"
- Technical requirements: "on-premise," "cloud," "security," "data"
- Words: "technical," "integration," "implementation," "migrate," "deploy," "API"

---

## Classification Decision Tree

When an objection is ambiguous, follow this decision tree:

```
1. Does the objection mention money, price, or budget?
   YES -> Category 1: Price/Budget
   NO  -> Continue

2. Does the objection mention a specific competitor?
   YES -> Category 5: Competition
   NO  -> Continue

3. Does the objection reference another person or approval process?
   YES -> Category 3: Authority
   NO  -> Continue

4. Does the objection mention timing, delay, or other priorities?
   YES -> Category 2: Timing
   NO  -> Continue

5. Does the objection reference technology, integration, or implementation?
   YES -> Category 8: Technical
   NO  -> Continue

6. Does the objection express doubt about the vendor's ability or reliability?
   YES -> Category 6: Risk/Trust
   NO  -> Continue

7. Does the objection express satisfaction with the current approach?
   YES -> Is the satisfaction about the process itself (Status Quo)
          or about not seeing the need (Need/Fit)?
   STATUS QUO -> Category 7
   NEED/FIT   -> Category 4

8. If none of the above:
   -> Classify as the closest match with "Low" confidence
   -> Provide responses for the top 2 most likely categories
```

## Frequency Data by Category

### How Often Each Objection Type Appears

| Category | % of Conversations | Avg. Occurrences per Deal | Impact on Win Rate |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Price/Budget | 64% | 2.3 | Neutral (if handled well) |
| Timing/Urgency | 48% | 1.7 | -15% (if unresolved) |
| Authority | 42% | 1.4 | -8% (extends cycle, not necessarily kills) |
| Need/Fit | 35% | 1.1 | -25% (fundamental mismatch signal) |
| Competition | 31% | 1.8 | -12% (if unaddressed) |
| Risk/Trust | 27% | 1.2 | -18% (trust is hard to rebuild once lost) |
| Status Quo | 24% | 1.0 | -30% (highest kill rate when unresolved) |
| Technical | 19% | 1.5 | -10% (usually solvable with evidence) |

*Source: Gong.io analysis of 1M+ sales calls, RAIN Group Win-Loss Analysis, CSO Insights*

### Key Insight

**Status quo objections have the highest kill rate when unresolved** (-30% win rate impact) even though they appear in only 24% of conversations. This is because status quo objections attack the fundamental premise of the sale -- the prospect questions whether change is necessary at all. Price objections, despite being the most common, have neutral impact when handled well because they indicate engagement, not rejection.

---

## Multi-Objection Handling

When a prospect raises multiple objections in a single statement or conversation, prioritize handling them in this order:

### Priority Order for Multi-Objection Scenarios

| Priority | Category to Address First | Reasoning |
|----------|--------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Need/Fit | If they don't need it, nothing else matters |
| 2 | Authority | If they can't decide, address the process before the details |
| 3 | Status Quo | If they won't change, features and pricing are irrelevant |
| 4 | Price/Budget | Address only after value is established |
| 5 | Risk/Trust | Build credibility through the conversation |
| 6 | Competition | Differentiate once they agree on the need |
| 7 | Technical | Usually the most solvable; save for later |
| 8 | Timing | Often resolves once other objections are addressed |

### Multi-Objection Response Pattern

```
"You've raised a few important points. Let me address the most important one first:
[Address primary objection using AQR framework]

I also heard you mention [secondary objection]. Once we've resolved [primary],
I'd love to address that as well. Does that work?"
```

This approach:
1. Acknowledges all objections (the prospect feels heard)
2. Focuses the conversation (avoids scattershot responses)
3. Gets agreement on the approach (maintains control of the dialogue)
4. Prevents the rep from rambling through all objections at once
