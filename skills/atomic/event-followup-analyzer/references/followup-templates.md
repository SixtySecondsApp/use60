## Follow-Up Timing Data

The data on follow-up timing is unequivocal:

| Timing | Response Rate | Relative Performance | Source |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Within 1 hour | 7x baseline | Best possible -- extremely rare | InsideSales.com / XANT |
| Within 24 hours | 4.5x baseline | Gold standard for HOT leads | Bizzabo (2023) |
| 24-48 hours | 2.8x baseline | Strong -- still within the warm window | SiriusDecisions |
| 48-72 hours | 1.5x baseline | Acceptable for WARM/COOL leads | HubSpot Event Marketing |
| 3-5 days | 1.1x baseline | Marginal -- event memory fading | Marketo |
| 5+ days | 0.7x baseline | Below cold outreach performance | SiriusDecisions |

**The "First Mover" effect:** The first sales rep to follow up after an event wins the conversation 78% of the time (InsideSales.com). Speed is not just a factor -- it is THE factor.

**Optimal send timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM in the recipient's timezone. Avoid Monday (inbox overload after the event) and Friday (low engagement). Exception: If the event ends on a Friday, send HOT follow-ups that same day -- do not wait until Monday.
