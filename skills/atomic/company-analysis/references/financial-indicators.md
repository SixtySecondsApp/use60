## Why Salespeople Need Financial Literacy

You do not need to read balance sheets. You need to answer two questions:

1. **Can they afford your product?** If the answer is no, you are wasting time regardless of how good the fit is.
2. **Is now a good time to sell to them?** A company that just raised $50M has different buying behavior than one that is 22 months into a funding round with 24 months of runway.

Financial literacy for sales is not about understanding GAAP accounting. It is about reading signals -- funding, hiring, spending patterns, growth rate -- and translating them into timing and approach decisions.

## Funding Round Significance

### What Each Funding Stage Means for Buying Capacity

| Stage | Typical Amount | What It Means | Buying Behavior |
|-------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Pre-Seed** | $50K-$500K | Idea stage. Building MVP. 1-5 people. | Cannot buy anything. Free tools only. Do not pursue. |
| **Seed** | $500K-$5M | Product exists. Finding product-market fit. 5-20 people. | Very limited budget. May buy 1-2 critical tools ($100-500/month). Price sensitivity is extreme. |
| **Series A** | $5M-$20M | Product-market fit found. Scaling go-to-market. 20-80 people. | Budget emerging. Building the first real tech stack. Open to tool purchases that directly drive growth. ACV tolerance: $5K-$25K. |
| **Series B** | $15M-$60M | Scaling proven model. Rapid hiring. 50-200 people. | **Best buying window.** Building departments, formalizing processes, standardizing tools. ACV tolerance: $15K-$75K. |
| **Series C** | $30M-$150M | Scaling to dominance. 150-500 people. Enterprise features needed. | Significant budget. More formal procurement. May require SOC2, SSO, SLAs. ACV tolerance: $30K-$200K+. |
| **Series D+** | $50M-$500M+ | Late stage, pre-IPO. 300-2000+ people. | Large budget but heavy procurement processes. RFPs, security reviews, legal negotiations. Long cycles. ACV tolerance: $50K-$500K+. |
| **Growth Equity** | $100M+ | Proven business, optimizing for profitability or IPO prep. | Mature buyer. Consolidating tools. May be replacing, not adding. Budget available but scrutinized. |
| **Public (IPO+)** | N/A | Quarterly earnings pressure. Budget cycles are formal. | Very large budget but highly bureaucratic. Annual planning cycles. Quarterly budget constraints. 6-18 month sales cycles. |

### The Post-Funding Window

The 90-day window after a funding round is the single best time to sell to a company.

**Why**: Fresh capital, new hiring mandates, infrastructure buildout, tool evaluation checklists. The CEO and board have agreed on a growth plan, and that plan requires tools to execute.

**Data**: Companies are 3.4x more likely to evaluate new vendors within 90 days of funding (Crunchbase + SalesIntel analysis, 2024).

**After 90 days**: The initial tool buying spree slows. Budget allocation hardens. New purchases require more justification.

**After 12 months**: Most discretionary budget is allocated. New purchases are competing against existing line items.

**After 18 months**: If no new funding and no visible revenue milestones, the company may be entering budget conservation mode.

### Funding Round Red Flags

| Signal | What It Means | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Down round** (lower valuation than prior round) | Investors lost confidence. Budget is tightening. | Proceed with extreme caution. Short sales cycles only. |
| **Bridge round / extension** | Between major rounds. Runway may be limited. | Check hiring patterns. If still hiring, probably okay. If freezing, bad sign. |
| **Insider-only round** (only existing investors participated) | New investors did not want in. May signal problems. | Not always negative (existing investors may just be doubling down), but verify with other signals. |
| **No funding in 24+ months, no revenue milestones** | Either profitable (great) or struggling to raise (concerning). | Check headcount trend. Growing = profitable. Shrinking = struggling. |
| **Strategic investor** (not a VC, but a company in their industry) | May signal acquisition interest or strategic direction. | Positive signal usually. But the strategic investor may influence tool decisions. |

## Revenue Signal Detection

Most private companies do not share revenue. But you can triangulate using proxy signals.

### Direct Revenue Signals

| Signal | Confidence | Where to Find It |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Revenue milestone press release ("$10M ARR," "$50M ARR") | Very High | PR Newswire, company blog, TechCrunch |
| Inc 5000 / Deloitte Fast 500 ranking | High | Rankings include revenue ranges |
| SaaS Mag / SaaStr data | High | Community-reported but editorially reviewed |
| SEC filings (if public) | Very High | 10-K, 10-Q filings |
| Investor portfolio page ("$20M ARR company") | Medium-High | VC websites sometimes disclose portfolio metrics |

### Indirect Revenue Signals

| Signal | How to Infer Revenue | Confidence |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Employee count** | SaaS: $150K-$300K revenue per employee. Services: $100K-$200K per employee. | Medium (wide range) |
| **Pricing page + estimated customers** | If price is $50/seat/month and G2 shows 500+ reviews (suggesting 2,000+ customers at ~25% review rate), estimate $1.2M+ MRR | Low-Medium |
| **G2/Capterra review volume** | 100+ reviews typically = 500+ customers. 500+ reviews = 2,000+ customers. | Low-Medium |
| **Job posting volume** | Companies typically spend 30-40% of revenue on S&M. If hiring aggressively, revenue must support it. | Low |
| **Office size / location** | A 50-person company in a premium downtown office is spending $500K+ on rent -- revenue must support it. | Low |
| **Competitor benchmarking** | If their closest competitor (similar size, similar stage) has disclosed revenue, use as a range estimate. | Low-Medium |

### Revenue Per Employee Benchmarks

| Company Type | Revenue / Employee | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| High-efficiency SaaS | $300K-$500K | Zoom, Atlassian, Datadog class. Product-led, low-touch. |
| Standard SaaS | $150K-$300K | Most B2B SaaS companies fall here. |
| Early-stage SaaS | $80K-$150K | Still investing ahead of revenue. Below efficient level. |
| Professional services | $100K-$200K | Lower margins, more headcount-intensive. |
| Consulting (high-end) | $200K-$400K | Big 4, McKinsey class. Premium billing rates. |
| Hardware + software | $150K-$350K | Varies widely by hardware margin. |
| E-commerce / marketplace | $200K-$500K | Platform businesses can be very efficient. |

**How to use**: Find employee count (LinkedIn), identify company type, multiply. This gives a rough revenue range, not a precise figure.

**Example**: DataPulse has 180 employees and is a standard B2B SaaS company. Revenue estimate: 180 x $200K = $36M (low end) to 180 x $300K = $54M (high end). Midpoint estimate: $45M ARR.

## Burn Rate and Runway Assessment

### What Burn Rate Tells You

Burn rate is how fast a company is spending its cash. High burn rate with high growth is normal. High burn rate with no growth is dangerous.

### Estimating Burn Rate

```
Annual Burn Estimate = Employee Count x Average Fully-Loaded Cost

Fully-loaded cost by region:
  - SF/NYC/London tech:     $180K-$250K per employee per year
  - Austin/Denver/Boston:   $150K-$200K per employee per year
  - Remote-first US:        $130K-$180K per employee per year
  - International (lower COL): $80K-$130K per employee per year

Add 20-30% for non-payroll costs (office, tools, infrastructure, marketing)
```

**Example**: DataPulse, 180 employees, Austin headquarters.
- Payroll estimate: 180 x $175K = $31.5M/year
- Non-payroll (25%): $7.9M
- Total estimated burn: ~$39M/year
- Monthly burn: ~$3.3M

### Estimating Runway

```
Runway (months) = (Total Funding Raised - Estimated Revenue to Date) / Monthly Burn

Simplified version (for companies with limited revenue):
Runway (months) = Last Round Amount / Monthly Burn
```

**Example**: DataPulse raised $45M Series B 14 months ago. If monthly burn is $3.3M:
- If no revenue: $45M / $3.3M = ~14 months of runway at the time of raise. 14 months later, runway is near zero.
- But DataPulse likely has $36-54M in revenue. So actual runway is much longer.

**Key insight**: Burn rate analysis is most useful for pre-revenue or early-revenue companies. For companies with significant revenue, burn rate alone is misleading -- net burn (expenses minus revenue) is what matters.

### Runway Traffic Light

| Estimated Runway | Color | What It Means for You |
|-----------------|-------|----------------------|
| 18+ months | Green | Comfortable. Normal buying behavior. No financial pressure. |
| 12-18 months | Yellow | Watchful. Budget may tighten. But still buying if ROI is clear. |
| 6-12 months | Orange | Pressure mounting. May be fundraising. Budget cuts likely. Short-cycle deals only. |
| <6 months | Red | Survival mode. Almost certainly not buying new tools. Focus on renewals if existing customer. |

## Public Company Financial Health Metrics

For publicly traded prospects, financial data is available in SEC filings. Here are the metrics that matter for sales, explained without finance jargon.

### Gross Margin

**What it is**: How much money the company keeps from each dollar of revenue after paying for the cost of delivering their product.

**Formula**: (Revenue - Cost of Revenue) / Revenue x 100

| Gross Margin | What It Means |
|-------------|--------------|
| 70-85% | Typical SaaS. Healthy. Product scales well. Money available for sales and R&D. |
| 50-70% | Lower efficiency. May have significant services component. Budget exists but is tighter. |
| 30-50% | Low margin business. Very cost-conscious. Your product needs to clearly save more than it costs. |
| <30% | Very tight margins. Hardware, logistics, or commodity business. Extremely price-sensitive buyer. |

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**What it is**: How much revenue the company retains from existing customers year-over-year, including expansion (upsells) and churn (downgrades/cancellations).

**Why it matters for sales**: NRR tells you how healthy the company's customer base is.

| NRR | What It Means |
|-----|--------------|
| 130%+ | Exceptional. Customers love the product and spend more each year. Very healthy company. |
| 110-130% | Strong. Expansion outpaces churn. Growing efficiently. |
| 100-110% | Moderate. Revenue is stable but not expanding much from existing customers. |
| 90-100% | Concerning. Some churn is happening. Company may be focused on plugging leaks. |
| <90% | Leaky bucket. Significant churn. Company is under pressure. Budget for new tools may be redirected to fixing churn. |

### Rule of 40

**What it is**: Revenue growth rate + profit margin should be >= 40%.

**Example**: 30% revenue growth + 15% profit margin = 45% (passing). 10% revenue growth + 5% profit margin = 15% (failing).

| Rule of 40 Score | What It Means |
|-----------------|--------------|
| 60%+ | Elite. Hypergrowth + profitability. Very healthy buyer. |
| 40-60% | Strong. Balanced growth and efficiency. Standard buyer behavior. |
| 20-40% | Moderate. Either growing fast with losses, or growing slowly with some profit. Normal. |
| <20% | Struggling. Neither growing fast nor profitable. Budget under pressure. |

### Free Cash Flow (FCF)

**What it is**: Cash generated by the business after all expenses and capital expenditures. The money actually available to spend.

| FCF Status | What It Means |
|-----------|--------------|
| Positive and growing | Self-funding. Does not need external capital. Confident buyer. |
| Positive but flat | Stable. Has cash but not generating more. Normal buyer. |
| Negative but improving | Investing in growth. Burning cash but the trend is improving. |
| Negative and worsening | Spending more than earning and the gap is growing. Red flag. |

---

## Warning Signs and Red Flags

### Layoff Signals

Layoffs are the most visible red flag. But context matters enormously.

| Layoff Type | What It Means | Action |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Company-wide layoff (10%+)** | Serious cost cutting. Budget frozen for 3-6 months. | Pause outreach for 60-90 days. When you resume, position as efficiency/cost-saving. |
| **Department-specific layoff** | Reorganization, not necessarily company-wide distress. | If layoff is NOT in your buyer's department, you may be fine. Verify. |
| **"Restructuring" with simultaneous hiring** | Pivoting. Cutting in one area, investing in another. | Find out which area is growing. That is where budget is flowing. |
| **CEO departure** | Major instability. New CEO will reset priorities. | Wait for new CEO to settle (60-90 days), then approach with a clean slate. |
| **Multiple exec departures in 6 months** | Organizational dysfunction or disagreement on direction. | High risk. Deals will stall in this environment. |

### Funding Gap Signals

| Signal | Concern Level | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Last funding 12-18 months ago, hiring slowing | Medium | Normal funding cycle. May be preparing for next round. |
| Last funding 18-24 months ago, no revenue milestones | High | Either profitable (check) or approaching funding pressure. |
| Last funding 24+ months ago, headcount declining | Very High | Likely in trouble. Budget is being cut. |
| Last funding 24+ months ago, headcount stable/growing | Low | Likely profitable or bootstrapping successfully. Positive signal. |
| Raised a bridge/extension round | Medium-High | Needed cash before a full round. Some investor uncertainty. |

### Leadership Departure Patterns

| Pattern | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|
| CTO departs, no replacement announced | Technical leadership vacuum. Product development may slow. May be concerning. |
| VP Sales departs after <18 months | Sales strategy is not working. New VP will re-evaluate everything -- including your product if you are a vendor. |
| CFO departs before IPO or funding round | Serious red flag. CFOs rarely leave before financial milestones unless something is wrong. |
| Co-founder departs | Can be amicable (they were always operational and want to move on) or alarming (fundamental disagreement). Context matters. |
| Multiple departures, same month | Board-initiated shakeup. Major strategic change incoming. Pause and reassess. |

## Financial Health Rating System

### The 5-Signal Assessment

Score each signal 1-5, then calculate the weighted average:

| Signal | Weight | Score 5 | Score 3 | Score 1 |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Funding recency** | 25% | Raised <6 months ago | Raised 12-18 months ago | Raised 24+ months ago, no revenue signals |
| **Revenue signals** | 25% | Public milestones, strong proxies | Some proxies, moderate confidence | No signals, cannot estimate |
| **Headcount trend** | 20% | Growing 20%+ YoY | Stable (0-5% growth) | Declining (layoffs) |
| **Leadership stability** | 15% | Core team intact 12+ months | 1 departure, replaced | Multiple departures, gaps |
| **Market signals** | 15% | Positive press, awards, partnerships | Neutral, no news | Negative press, customer complaints |

### Rating Scale

| Weighted Score | Rating | Description | Sales Approach |
|---------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 4.0-5.0 | **Strong** | Healthy, growing, well-funded | Full speed. Standard process. |
| 3.0-3.9 | **Stable** | Adequate signals, no red flags | Normal pursuit. No financial concerns. |
| 2.0-2.9 | **Cautious** | Mixed signals, some concerns | Shorter cycles preferred. Strong ROI case required. |
| 1.0-1.9 | **Concerning** | Multiple red flags | Consider not pursuing. If pursuing, rapid-close deals only. |

## Revenue Inference Methods

### Method 1: Employee Count Triangulation

The most accessible method. Available for nearly every company via LinkedIn.

```
Step 1: Find employee count (LinkedIn company page)
Step 2: Identify company type (SaaS, services, marketplace)
Step 3: Multiply by revenue-per-employee benchmark range
Step 4: Adjust for known factors (recent funding, aggressive hiring = may be below efficiency)
Step 5: Report as a range, not a point estimate
```

### Method 2: Funding-Based Inference

Investors target specific revenue multiples for each stage.

| Stage | Typical Revenue Multiple at Investment | Inference |
|-------|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| Series A ($10M raise at $40M valuation) | 10-20x ARR | ARR: $2M-$4M |
| Series B ($30M raise at $150M valuation) | 8-15x ARR | ARR: $10M-$19M |
| Series C ($60M raise at $500M valuation) | 6-12x ARR | ARR: $42M-$83M |
| Series D+ ($100M raise at $1B valuation) | 5-10x ARR | ARR: $100M-$200M |

**Caution**: These multiples vary significantly by year, market conditions, and sector. 2021 multiples were 2-3x higher than 2023-2024 multiples.

### Method 3: Customer Count Estimation

```
Step 1: Count G2/Capterra reviews. Multiply by 4-5x to estimate customer count.
        (Approximately 20-25% of customers leave reviews when incentivized)
Step 2: Estimate ARPU from pricing page (if available)
Step 3: Estimated Revenue = Customer Count x ARPU
```

### Method 4: Competitor Benchmarking

If a close competitor with similar size and stage has disclosed revenue, use it as a benchmark:

```
Step 1: Identify closest comparable company (same market, similar size, similar stage)
Step 2: Find their disclosed revenue
Step 3: Adjust for relative size (your target's employee count / comparable's employee count)
Step 4: Report as "comparable suggests revenue in the range of $X-$Y"
```

## Budget Cycle Intelligence

### When Companies Budget

| Company Type | Budget Cycle | Best Time to Sell | Worst Time to Sell |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Calendar year (Jan-Dec) | October-November planning | August-November (before budget locks) and January-March (new budget, ready to spend) | December (frozen) and June-August (budget mid-cycle, committed) |
| Fiscal year (Jul-Jun) | April-May planning | February-May and July-September | June (year-end freeze) and December-January (mid-cycle) |
| Government fiscal year | Varies by jurisdiction | Q3-Q4 of their fiscal year ("use it or lose it") | Q1 (just started, cautious) |
| Startup (no formal cycle) | Rolling, founder-driven | Anytime post-funding | When runway is <12 months and no new round in sight |

### Budget Hack: The "Use It or Lose It" Window

Many companies have a "use it or lose it" dynamic in Q4 of their fiscal year. Unspent budget gets clawed back. This creates urgency to spend on tools that have been "nice to have" all year.

**How to identify**: Ask the prospect during Q3: "When does your fiscal year end?" If it ends in Q4 and they have budget remaining, you have natural urgency.

### Budget Hack: The New Leader Window

When a new VP, Director, or C-level joins, they have a 90-day window where they:
1. Evaluate the existing tool stack
2. Make "their" tool choices
3. Have organizational permission to spend (because they are new and need to "set up for success")

**How to identify**: Monitor LinkedIn for role changes at target accounts. The 30-90 day window after a leadership hire is prime selling time.
