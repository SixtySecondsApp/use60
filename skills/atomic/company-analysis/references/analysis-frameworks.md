## Porter's Five Forces (Sales-Adapted)

### Why Sales Reps Need This

Porter's Five Forces tells you how much power the prospect company has in its market. This matters because:
- Companies with strong market positions are more confident buyers (less price-sensitive, faster decisions)
- Companies under intense competitive pressure are more risk-averse (need more proof, longer cycles)
- Companies with high supplier power may already be locked into ecosystems that affect your integration story

### The Five Forces, Adapted for Sales Intelligence

#### 1. Competitive Rivalry (How fierce is their market?)

| Intensity | Indicators | Sales Implication |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Low** | Few competitors, clear market leader, differentiated products | Stable company. Confident buyer. Less urgency to change. |
| **Medium** | Several competitors, moderate differentiation, some price competition | Normal buying behavior. Standard evaluation processes. |
| **High** | Many competitors, commoditized market, aggressive pricing | Stressed company. May be distracted by competitive battles. But also may need tools to gain an edge. |

**Data sources**: G2/Capterra competitive grids, competitor count on review sites, pricing comparison availability.

#### 2. Threat of New Entrants (Is their market being disrupted?)

| Threat Level | Indicators | Sales Implication |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Low** | High barriers (regulation, capital, network effects), established incumbents | Stable market. Long-term customer. |
| **Medium** | Moderate barriers, some new entrants but not threatening the core | Normal. Watch for shifts. |
| **High** | Low barriers, frequent new entrants, AI/technology disruption | Company may be under pressure. May be looking for tools to defend market position. Urgency opportunity. |

**Data sources**: Crunchbase (new companies in their category), news about category disruption, analyst reports.

#### 3. Buyer Power (How much leverage do their customers have?)

| Power Level | Indicators | Sales Implication |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Low** | Sticky product, high switching costs, few alternatives | Their revenue is stable. Good long-term account. |
| **Medium** | Moderate switching costs, some alternatives available | Normal churn risk. Standard budget behavior. |
| **High** | Easy to switch, many alternatives, price-sensitive customers | Revenue is at risk. May be cautious with new tool purchases. May also be seeking tools to improve retention. |

**Data sources**: Review sites (churn mentions), pricing model (annual vs. monthly -- monthly = lower switching costs for their customers), net revenue retention if disclosed.

#### 4. Supplier Power (How dependent are they on key vendors?)

| Power Level | Indicators | Sales Implication |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Low** | Multiple vendor options, commodity inputs, low switching costs | Flexible buyer. Can evaluate and switch tools relatively easily. |
| **Medium** | Some vendor dependencies, moderate switching costs | Normal evaluation cycle. Consider integration story. |
| **High** | Locked into key platforms (Salesforce, AWS, etc.), high switching costs | Your product must integrate with their existing ecosystem. Switching is hard -- position as a complement, not a replacement. |

**Data sources**: Tech stack analysis, integration pages, job postings mentioning specific platforms.

#### 5. Threat of Substitutes (Can their product be replaced by something different?)

| Threat Level | Indicators | Sales Implication |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Low** | No viable substitutes, unique value proposition | Strong company. Confident in their market. Good buyer. |
| **Medium** | Some substitutes emerging but not yet threatening | Monitoring mode. Standard buying behavior. |
| **High** | AI, automation, or platform shifts threatening their core product | Existential pressure. May be focused on survival, not optimization. OR may be buying tools to adapt. Read the signals carefully. |

**Data sources**: Industry analyst reports, news about category disruption, AI impact assessments.

### SWOT-to-Sales-Strategy Translation

Each SWOT quadrant translates directly to a sales approach:

| SWOT Quadrant | Sales Strategy |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Strengths** | Leverage these in your pitch. "Companies that lead in [their strength] typically need [your product] to maintain that advantage." |
| **Weaknesses** | If your product addresses a weakness, this is your primary value proposition. Approach with sensitivity -- no one likes being told about their weaknesses. |
| **Opportunities** | Position your product as an enabler of their opportunities. "As you expand into [market], you'll need [your capability]." |
| **Threats** | Position your product as protection against their threats. "With [competitor/disruption] gaining ground, teams that [your value prop] maintain their edge." |

### Data Gathering for SWOT

| SWOT Element | Where to Find It |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Strengths | Company website (what they brag about), G2 reviews (what customers praise), funding announcements |
| Weaknesses | G2/Capterra negative reviews, job postings (what they are trying to fix), news about challenges |
| Opportunities | Industry reports, their product roadmap (if public), hiring patterns (what functions they are building) |
| Threats | Competitor launches, industry disruption news, regulatory changes, macroeconomic trends |

## Business Model Canvas Extraction

### Why Sales Needs This

Understanding a company's business model tells you:
- Where their revenue comes from (so you can speak their language about ROI)
- Who their customers are (so you can position with relevant examples)
- What their cost structure looks like (so you can frame your product's value appropriately)
- What their key activities are (so you know what they prioritize day-to-day)

### Business Model Archetypes and Sales Implications

| Archetype | Characteristics | Sales Approach |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **PLG (Product-Led Growth)** | Free tier, self-serve, bottom-up adoption | Find the internal champion who already uses the product. Position for enterprise rollout. |
| **SLG (Sales-Led Growth)** | Contact sales, demos, AE-driven | Standard enterprise sales motion. Find the economic buyer. |
| **MLG (Marketing-Led Growth)** | Content-heavy, inbound funnel, demand gen | Marketing team controls budget and tool decisions. Target CMO/VP Marketing. |
| **Partner-Led** | Channel sales, VAR/SI partnerships, ecosystem play | Identify the partner who can introduce you. Or sell directly to the partner. |
| **Platform** | API-first, developer adoption, ecosystem | Developer relations or technical champion is the entry point. |

## Competitive Moat Assessment

### The Six Moats

For each moat type, assess whether the prospect company has it and how strong it is. This tells you about their stability as a customer.

#### 1. Network Effects

**Definition**: More users make the product more valuable for all users.

| Strength | Evidence |
|----------|---------|
| **Strong** | Marketplace with both sides active, collaboration tool with team-wide adoption, social features that require participation |
| **Moderate** | Some network benefits but product has standalone value, growing user base but not yet self-reinforcing |
| **Weak/None** | Product value is independent of user count |

**Sales implication**: Companies with strong network effects are very stable customers (low churn risk) but harder to sell to (high switching costs mean they resist change).

#### 2. Switching Costs

**Definition**: The cost (financial, time, data, workflow) of moving to an alternative.

| Strength | Evidence |
|----------|---------|
| **Strong** | Deep data integration, workflow dependencies, training investment, regulatory compliance built on the platform |
| **Moderate** | Some data migration required, moderate retraining, but alternatives exist |
| **Weak** | Easy to export data, minimal workflow disruption, short ramp time for alternatives |

**Sales implication**: High switching costs for their product mean stable revenue and confident buying. But high switching costs in their TOOL STACK mean you need to prove displacement value exceeds switching pain.

#### 3. Data Advantages

**Definition**: Proprietary data that improves with usage and is difficult to replicate.

| Strength | Evidence |
|----------|---------|
| **Strong** | ML/AI products that improve with data, proprietary datasets, unique data collection mechanisms |
| **Moderate** | Some proprietary data but not core to the product, data supplements rather than drives |
| **Weak** | Uses publicly available data, no proprietary data asset |

**Sales implication**: Data moats correlate with technical sophistication. These companies are more likely to evaluate tools rigorously and require strong technical proof.

#### 4. Brand/Trust

| Strength | Evidence |
|----------|---------|
| **Strong** | Household name in their category, strong NPS, trusted in sensitive areas (security, finance, healthcare) |
| **Moderate** | Known in their niche, positive reputation, growing brand |
| **Weak** | Unknown brand, new entrant, no brand recognition |

#### 5. Regulatory/Compliance

| Strength | Evidence |
|----------|---------|
| **Strong** | FedRAMP, SOC2 Type II, HIPAA, PCI-DSS certifications that are expensive and time-consuming to obtain |
| **Moderate** | Some compliance certifications, basic security posture |
| **Weak** | No formal compliance requirements, minimal certifications |

**Sales implication**: Companies with regulatory moats will require your product to meet their compliance standards. Verify before investing in the deal.

#### 6. Scale Advantages

| Strength | Evidence |
|----------|---------|
| **Strong** | Cost advantages from volume, infrastructure efficiency at scale, distribution leverage |
| **Moderate** | Some scale benefits but not decisive, growing into scale advantages |
| **Weak** | No significant scale advantages, similar costs to smaller competitors |

### Moat Scorecard

```
Company: _______________

Moat Type          | Strength (1-5) | Evidence

Regulatory         |                |
Scale              |                |

Overall Moat:      [ ] Wide  [ ] Narrow  [ ] None
Customer Stability: [ ] Very High  [ ] High  [ ] Medium  [ ] Low

## Growth Trajectory Scoring

### Leading Indicators (Predict Future Growth)

| Indicator | Weight | How to Measure | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Hiring velocity | 25% | Open roles / total employees. >10% = rapid, 5-10% = active, <5% = steady | |
| Funding recency | 20% | Months since last round. <6 = hot, 6-12 = warm, 12-18 = cooling, >18 = cold | |
| Product expansion | 20% | New products, tiers, or features launched in last 6 months | |
| Leadership hires | 15% | Senior executives hired in growth functions (sales, marketing, product) | |
| Market expansion | 20% | New geographies, verticals, or customer segments entered | |

### Lagging Indicators (Confirm Past Growth)

| Indicator | Weight | How to Measure | Score 1-5 |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Headcount growth | 30% | LinkedIn historical or Crunchbase. >30% YoY = rapid, 15-30% = active | |
| Revenue milestones | 25% | Public announcements of ARR milestones, revenue achievements | |
| Customer count growth | 20% | G2 review velocity, case study volume, logo additions | |
| Office expansion | 15% | New locations, larger headquarters, international offices | |
| Brand visibility | 10% | Conference sponsorships, media coverage, thought leadership | |

### Growth Trajectory Ratings

| Rating | Leading Score | Lagging Score | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Rapid Growth** | 4.0+ | 3.5+ | Multiple indicators firing. Best prospects -- budget, urgency, willingness. |
| **Steady Growth** | 3.0-3.9 | 2.5-3.4 | Moderate signals. Good prospects with normal cycles. |
| **Stable/Mature** | 2.0-2.9 | 2.0-2.9 | Minimal change. Longer cycles but potentially larger deals. |
| **Declining** | <2.0 | <2.0 | Negative signals. Layoffs, closures, departures. Proceed with caution. |
| **Unknown** | N/A | N/A | Insufficient data. Note what signals would resolve. |

## Financial Health Assessment

### Red/Yellow/Green Thresholds

| Indicator | Green (Healthy) | Yellow (Caution) | Red (Concern) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Funding recency** | <12 months | 12-24 months | >24 months with no revenue signals |
| **Burn rate** (est.) | <60% of last round annually | 60-80% of last round annually | >80% annually (running low) |
| **Revenue per employee** | >$200K (SaaS) | $100K-$200K | <$100K |
| **Headcount trend** | Growing or stable | Flat with some departures | Shrinking (layoffs) |
| **Leadership stability** | Core team intact 12+ months | 1-2 executive departures | Multiple exec departures or CEO change |
| **Customer signals** | Positive reviews, growing logos | Mixed reviews, stable logos | Negative reviews, churning customers |
| **Funding-to-employee** | Reasonable ratio for stage | Overfunded (may be burning) | Underfunded for headcount |

### Quick Assessment Formula

```
Financial Health Score = (Funding Recency x 0.25) + (Revenue Signals x 0.25)
                       + (Headcount Trend x 0.20) + (Leadership Stability x 0.15)
                       + (Customer Signals x 0.15)

Where each component is scored 1-5:
  5 = Green (all positive signals)
  3 = Yellow (mixed signals)
  1 = Red (concerning signals)

Score >= 4.0: Strong
Score 3.0-3.9: Stable
Score 2.0-2.9: Cautious
Score < 2.0: Concerning
```

## Worked Example: SaaS Company

**Company**: DataPulse (fictional)
**What we know**: B2B SaaS, data analytics platform, 180 employees, raised $45M Series B (14 months ago), headquartered in Austin, TX.

### Five Forces Assessment

| Force | Rating | Evidence |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Competitive Rivalry | High | 15+ competitors on G2, aggressive pricing from new entrants |
| Threat of New Entrants | High | AI-native analytics tools entering market rapidly |
| Buyer Power | Medium | Annual contracts create some lock-in, but alternatives are plentiful |
| Supplier Power | Low | Built on commodity cloud infrastructure (AWS) |
| Threat of Substitutes | Medium | Some teams building internal analytics with open-source tools |

**Sales implication**: DataPulse is in a competitive, dynamic market. They are likely focused on differentiation and retention. Position your product as helping them compete more effectively, not as another vendor to manage.

### Financial Health

| Indicator | Assessment | Score |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Funding recency | 14 months -- slightly cooling | 3 |
| Revenue signals | 180 employees suggests $20-40M ARR range, no public milestones | 3 |
| Headcount trend | Grew from 120 to 180 (50% YoY) -- strong | 5 |
| Leadership stability | CTO departed 3 months ago, new CTO from Snowflake | 3 |
| Customer signals | G2 rating 4.3/5, 200+ reviews, mostly positive | 4 |

**Financial Health Score**: (3 x 0.25) + (3 x 0.25) + (5 x 0.20) + (3 x 0.15) + (4 x 0.15) = 3.55 -- **Stable**

### Growth Trajectory

| Leading Indicator | Score | Evidence |
|------------------|-------|---------|
| Hiring velocity | 4 | 12 open roles / 180 employees = 6.7% |
| Funding recency | 3 | 14 months, still within window |
| Product expansion | 4 | Launched AI features and self-serve tier |
| Leadership hires | 3 | New CTO, but departure of previous CTO is a concern |
| Market expansion | 3 | Exploring EMEA but no office yet |

**Growth Trajectory**: Steady Growth (trending toward Rapid) -- **Good prospect with normal timing.**

---

## Worked Example: Services Company

**Company**: Meridian Consulting (fictional)
**What we know**: IT consulting and systems integration, 85 employees, bootstrapped (no external funding), headquartered in Chicago, serves mid-market financial services companies.

### Five Forces Assessment

| Force | Rating | Evidence |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Competitive Rivalry | High | Dozens of IT consulting firms, price competition intense |
| Threat of New Entrants | Medium | Low barriers but relationship-driven (existing clients are sticky) |
| Buyer Power | High | Clients can switch consultants relatively easily, price-compare aggressively |
| Supplier Power | Medium | Dependent on certified consultants who are in demand |
| Threat of Substitutes | Medium-High | AI and automation reducing need for manual consulting work |

**Sales implication**: Meridian operates in a competitive, relationship-driven market with high buyer power. They need tools that help them differentiate or deliver more efficiently. Price sensitivity is likely high -- they pass costs through to clients.

### Financial Health

| Indicator | Assessment | Score |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Funding recency | N/A -- bootstrapped | 3 (neutral -- self-funded is not negative) |
| Revenue signals | 85 employees x $150K per employee (services) = ~$12M revenue | 3 |
| Headcount trend | Stable at ~85 for 2 years | 3 |
| Leadership stability | Founder-led, same leadership team for 5+ years | 5 |
| Customer signals | Strong client references, but no public review presence | 3 |

**Financial Health Score**: 3.30 -- **Stable**

**Key difference from SaaS**: Services companies have different financial profiles. They are typically cash-flow positive (billing clients covers costs) but have lower margins and less growth potential. Budget for tools is tighter because every dollar spent on tools comes directly from margin.
