## Rescue Playbook: Champion Gone Dark

**Frequency**: 28% of at-risk deals. The most common rescue scenario.

**Core principle**: Do not keep doing what is not working. If email failed, switch channels. If your contact is silent, go around.

### Hour 0-4: Diagnose

1. Check LinkedIn: Did the champion change roles, get promoted, or leave the company?
2. Review last 3 interactions: Was there any negative signal (pushback, hesitation, delay request)?
3. Check email open tracking (if available): Are emails being opened but not replied to?
4. Identify 2-3 alternative contacts at the company

### Hour 4-24: Execute Primary Rescue

**Action 1: Channel-Switch Outreach to Champion**

Phone call script:
```
Hi [Name], it's [Your name] from [Company]. We had been
working on the [project name] evaluation. I know you're busy --
I just wanted to quickly check: is this still something your
team is focused on?

[If voicemail]:
Hi [Name], it's [Your name] from [Company]. Wanted to check in
on the [project name] -- if the timing has shifted, totally
understand. Let me know either way and I'll adjust on my end.
My number is [number].
```

**Action 2: Value-Add Email (different from previous outreach)**

```
Subject: [relevant industry insight]

[Name],

Came across this [article / data point / case study] and thought
of your team. [One sentence about why it's relevant to their
specific situation].

[Link or key finding]

No agenda -- just thought you'd find it useful.
```

### Hour 24-48: Go Around

**Action 3: Contact a Secondary Stakeholder**

Email template:
```
Subject: quick question about [project name]

Hi [Secondary Contact Name],

I had been working with [Champion Name] on [brief description
of the initiative]. I haven't been able to connect with them
recently and wanted to make sure we're supporting your team
properly.

Is the [project name] initiative still moving forward? If there's
a better person to coordinate with, happy to connect with them.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

Phone script to secondary contact:
```
Hi [Name], this is [Your name] from [Company]. I had been
working with [Champion] on [project]. I haven't been able to
reach them recently -- is the project still active? I just want
to make sure we're not dropping the ball on our end.
```

### Hour 48-72: Escalate or Breakup

If no response from any contact:
- Send the breakup email to the champion (see The Breakup Sequence below)
- Set a 90-day reactivation reminder in the CRM
- If the deal is high-value ($100K+), consider executive-to-executive outreach before the breakup

---

## Rescue Playbook: No Compelling Event

**Frequency**: 22% of at-risk deals. The slow death -- everything is "fine" but nothing moves.

**Core principle**: You cannot create urgency that does not exist. You can only FIND urgency or help the buyer SEE the urgency they are ignoring.

### Hour 0-4: Find the Hidden Urgency

Research these potential compelling events:
1. **Budget cycle**: When does their fiscal year end? Budget use-it-or-lose-it dates?
2. **Regulatory deadline**: Any compliance requirements approaching?
3. **Competitive threat**: Is a competitor launching something that changes the landscape?
4. **Executive mandate**: Did their CEO set a strategic goal with a deadline?
5. **Cost escalation**: Is the problem getting worse over time? Quantify monthly growth.

### Hour 4-24: Create Urgency with Data

**Action 1: Cost of Delay Email**

```
Subject: the cost of waiting on [project]

[Name],

I ran the numbers on what staying with the current approach
costs your team each month:

- [X] hours of manual work x [Y team members] = [Z] hours/month
- At loaded cost of $[A]/hour = $[B]/month
- Over the next 6 months: $[C] in productivity lost

That doesn't include [secondary impact: error rates, turnover
risk, customer churn, etc.].

I'm not trying to create pressure -- I just want to make sure the
timing decision is based on the real numbers.

If next quarter makes more sense, I'd suggest we at least
[small commitment: lock in pricing, start paperwork, do a pilot]
now so you're ready to move fast when the time comes.

What makes sense?
```

**Action 2: Introduce a Real Constraint**

Use only genuine constraints -- artificial urgency destroys trust:
- Implementation team capacity: "Our next available onboarding slot is [date]"
- Pricing validity: "This pricing is locked through [date] per our standard policy"
- Market timing: "Companies launching before [season/event] see 2x adoption"

### Hour 24-48: Propose a Smaller First Step

**Action 3: The Phased Approach**

```
Subject: a smaller way to start

[Name],

I know the full rollout is a bigger decision. What if we
started with a [pilot / Phase 1 / single team deployment]?

Here's what that would look like:
- Scope: [specific limited scope]
- Timeline: [2-4 weeks]
- Investment: [smaller amount]
- What you'd learn: [specific outcomes they'd validate]

This gives your team a chance to prove the value before
committing to the full initiative. And it gives you data for
the business case.

Would that make it easier to get started?
```

### Hour 48-72: If No Urgency Can Be Found

Be honest: "This deal may not be ready to close this quarter. Rather than pushing, I suggest we agree on a check-in date when the timing is better. When would that be?"

Set a specific reactivation date tied to a real event (budget cycle, fiscal year start, board meeting).

---

## Rescue Playbook: Missing Economic Buyer

**Frequency**: 18% of at-risk deals. The champion loves you, but the person with the money has never heard of you.

**Core principle**: The longer you go without economic buyer engagement, the lower the win rate. This must be fixed now, not later.

### Hour 0-4: Assess the Situation

1. Who is the economic buyer? (Name, title, what they care about)
2. Why have they not been engaged? (Champion blocking? No access? Not relevant yet?)
3. What does the economic buyer need to see? (ROI, risk reduction, strategic alignment)

### Hour 4-24: Arm the Champion

**Action 1: Build the Internal Sell Document**

Create a one-page executive summary the champion can share:
```
[COMPANY NAME] - Executive Summary

THE CHALLENGE
[1-2 sentences about the problem, using the buyer's language]

THE COST OF INACTION
- $[X]/month in [specific cost category]
- [Y]% impact on [business metric]
- Risk: [specific risk if nothing changes]

THE SOLUTION
[1-2 sentences about what you do, focused on outcomes]

THE PROOF
- [Customer A]: [metric result]
- [Customer B]: [metric result]

THE ASK
[What you need from the economic buyer: 20-min briefing,
budget approval, strategic alignment]

INVESTMENT: $[amount] | PAYBACK: [X months] | 3-YEAR VALUE: $[amount]
```

**Action 2: Coach the Champion on the Internal Pitch**

Phone script:
```
[Champion], I want to make sure you have everything you need to
bring [Economic Buyer Name] into the conversation.

A few questions:
1. What does [EB Name] care about most this quarter?
2. What objections do you expect them to raise?
3. Would it help if I prepared a one-page summary they can
   review before a meeting?
4. Would a brief executive-to-executive call be useful? My
   [VP/CEO] would be happy to spend 15 minutes.
```

### Hour 24-48: Request the Meeting

**Action 3: Direct Outreach to Economic Buyer**

```
Subject: [project name] - executive alignment

[Economic Buyer Name],

[Champion Name] and I have been working on [brief description
of the initiative]. Before we move to the next stage, I want
to make sure this aligns with your priorities for the team.

Would you have 20 minutes for a brief executive alignment
call? My [VP/CEO, Name] would join to discuss the strategic
fit and ROI we're seeing with similar organizations.

[Champion Name] can share the executive summary in advance so
we make the most of the time.

[Proposed dates/times]
```

## Rescue Playbook: Competitor Gained Advantage

**Frequency**: 12% of at-risk deals. The buyer is comparing you unfavorably.

**Core principle**: Never attack the competitor. Differentiate on the buyer's criteria. Win on what matters to THEM, not on what matters to you.

### Hour 0-4: Intelligence Gathering

Questions to ask the champion:
1. "Who else are you evaluating?"
2. "What are the top 3 criteria for your decision?"
3. "Where do you see each solution's strengths?"
4. "Is there a feature or capability driving the comparison?"

### Hour 4-24: Differentiate

**Action 1: Criteria-Based Positioning Email**

```
Subject: your evaluation criteria

[Name],

Thanks for sharing that you're also looking at [competitor].
That's a solid option for [what competitor does well].

Based on our conversations, the 3 things that matter most to
your team are:

1. [Criterion 1]: Here's how we approach it: [specific]
2. [Criterion 2]: [Customer X] saw [specific result]
3. [Criterion 3]: [Your differentiation, backed by evidence]

I think the decision comes down to [key differentiator]. Happy
to set up a focused comparison on that specific area if it
would help.
```

**Action 2: Arrange Competitive Reference Call**

Identify a customer who evaluated the same competitor and chose you. This is the most powerful competitive weapon. The message is not "we're better" but "someone like you chose us, and here's why."

### Hour 24-48: Address the Real Concern

**Action 3: Direct Conversation About the Decision**

Phone script:
```
[Name], I want to be upfront. I know you're evaluating
[competitor] as well, and that's smart -- you should be
thorough.

I have one request: before you make a final decision, let's
have a 20-minute call focused specifically on [the buyer's #1
criterion]. I think that's where the real difference is, and I
want to make sure you've seen our approach to it.

If after that call you feel [competitor] is the better fit, I'll
respect that completely. Fair?
```

### Hour 48-72: If Competitor Is Winning

If the buyer has clearly chosen the competitor, pivot to relationship preservation:
```
[Name], I appreciate you being transparent about the direction.
[Competitor] is a solid choice for [what they do well].

If anything changes, or if you want a second option down the
road, I'm here. I've also seen situations where companies
outgrow their initial solution within 12-18 months -- if that
happens, I'd love to reconnect.

Good luck with the implementation.
```

This graceful exit preserves the relationship for future opportunities.

## Rescue Playbook: Budget Issue

**Frequency**: 10% of at-risk deals. Budget was cut, never existed, or is insufficient.

### Hour 0-4: Assess Budget Reality

Determine which budget scenario applies:
1. **Budget was never approved**: The champion was hopeful but has no allocation
2. **Budget was cut**: Economic conditions changed, priorities shifted
3. **Budget exists but is too small**: The deal needs to be restructured
4. **Budget is in a different department**: The money exists, just not where you're looking

### Hour 4-24: Restructure the Deal

**For "budget too small":**
```
Subject: a way to make this work within budget

[Name],

I understand the full solution is outside the current budget.
Here's an approach that gets you started and proves the value:

Phase 1 (fits within $[budget]): [limited scope]
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]
- Timeline: [X weeks]

Phase 2 (next budget cycle): [full scope]
- Triggered by Phase 1 results
- Budget request supported by real data from Phase 1

This way you're not asking for the full investment upfront --
you're proving the ROI first.
```

**For "budget was cut":**
- Rebuild the business case with harder numbers
- Explore alternative budget holders (different department, different line item)
- Propose a deferred start aligned with the next budget cycle

### Hour 24-48: Find Alternative Funding

**Action**: Ask the champion about alternative budget sources
```
I understand the [original budget] is no longer available. A few
questions that might help us find a path:

1. Is there a different department that would benefit and could
   contribute budget?
2. Does your company have an innovation fund or strategic
   initiatives budget?
3. If we timed this to your next fiscal year, would budget
   be available?
4. Would a monthly payment structure (vs. annual upfront) make
   the economics work?
```

## Rescue Playbook: Technical Blocker

**Frequency**: 8% of at-risk deals. The technical team has raised concerns.

### Hour 0-4: Get Specific

The most important step: understand the exact technical concern. Vague "technical issues" cannot be resolved.

Phone script:
```
[Technical Contact], I understand there are some technical
concerns. I want to make sure we address the right things.

Can you walk me through the specific issues? I want to be
precise about what we need to solve.
```

### Hour 4-24: Engineer-to-Engineer Resolution

**Action**: Schedule a technical deep-dive between your solutions engineer and their technical team. Sales reps should NOT try to resolve technical objections alone.

```
Subject: technical deep-dive on [specific concern]

[Technical Contact],

I've looped in [SE Name], our solutions engineer who has
implemented [your solution] in [X] environments similar to yours.

Could we schedule a 45-minute technical session to address:
1. [Specific concern 1]
2. [Specific concern 2]
3. [Any integration questions]

[SE Name] can also share the architecture from [reference
customer in similar environment].

[Proposed times]
```

### Hour 24-48: Offer a Focused POC

If the concern cannot be resolved in a call:
```
Subject: proving it works in your environment

[Name],

Rather than debating whether the integration will work, let's
prove it. We'd like to offer a focused proof-of-concept:

- Scope: [specific integration or feature in question]
- Timeline: [5-10 business days]
- Your effort: [minimal -- specify what they need to provide]
- Our effort: [we handle the setup]
- Success criteria: [specific, measurable]

If it works, we move forward. If it doesn't, you've lost
nothing but a few hours of your team's time.
```

## Rescue Playbook: Organizational Change

**Frequency**: 7% of at-risk deals. The buyer's company is in flux.

### Hour 0-4: Map the New Landscape

Research questions:
1. Is the champion still at the company? (Check LinkedIn)
2. Who replaced them or took over the initiative?
3. What is the new leadership's stated priority?
4. Is this a reorganization, M&A, leadership change, or layoff?

### Hour 4-24: Reconnect

**If champion left the company:**
1. Reach out to the champion at their new company (they may buy again)
2. Identify the successor at the current company
3. Ask the champion for an introduction to their successor

**If new leadership:**
```
Subject: [project name] - fresh introduction

[New Decision Maker],

I'm [Your name] from [Company]. I had been working with
[Champion/Previous Contact] on [project description].

I understand priorities may have shifted with the recent changes.
I wanted to briefly introduce myself and share a one-page summary
of where we were in the evaluation, in case this is still
relevant to your team's goals.

[Attached: executive summary]

If this is still on the radar, I'd welcome a 15-minute call to
understand your priorities and see if there's alignment.

If the timing isn't right, no problem at all.
```

### Hour 24-72: Assess Viability

**If M&A**: Do not push. Set a 90-day reminder. All purchasing decisions freeze during active M&A.

**If layoffs**: Assess whether the initiative is still funded. If the team sponsoring it was affected, the deal may be dead. Be honest about this.

---

## Rescue Playbook: Poor Discovery / Bad Fit

**Frequency**: 5% of at-risk deals. Your solution does not fully solve their problem.

### The Honest Approach

```
[Name],

Based on our conversations, I want to be straightforward about
where we fit and where we don't:

What we do well for your use case:
- [Strength 1]
- [Strength 2]

Where there's a gap:
- [Honest gap 1]
- [Honest gap 2]

Options:
1. We focus on [subset that works] and address [gaps] in a
   future phase once [roadmap item] ships in [timeline]
2. We partner with [complementary solution] to cover the full
   scope
3. This might not be the right fit, and I'd rather tell you that
   now than after you've signed a contract

What feels right to you?
```

**Why honesty works**: Deals closed on false pretenses churn. Referrals from honest "not the right fit" conversations close. The long game always wins.

---

## The Breakup Sequence

Send exactly one breakup email after 21+ days of silence across all channels. Never send a second one.

```
Subject: closing the loop

[Name],

I've reached out a few times about [project/initiative] and
haven't heard back. Going to assume the timing isn't right.

I'll close this out on my end. If things change down the road,
I'm here.

Wishing you and the team well.

[Your name]
```

**Why breakups work**: Loss aversion. The prospect realizes the conversation is ending. Re-engages 15-20% of stalled deals within 48 hours (Gong Labs).

**Rules**:
- One breakup email per deal. Never two.
- Send via the same channel as previous communication.
- If no response within 5 business days, move deal to closed-lost.
- Set a 90-day reactivation reminder.

---

## Escalation Path Templates

### Executive-to-Executive Outreach

Use when: Champion is blocked, economic buyer is inaccessible, or deal value justifies it ($100K+).

```
Subject: [Company Name] partnership

[Executive Name],

My team has been working with [Champion] on [project]. I wanted
to reach out directly to share how we've helped companies like
[reference] achieve [specific result].

I know your time is valuable. Would 15 minutes work to discuss
whether this aligns with [their company's] priorities?

[Your Executive Name]
[Title]
```

### Manager Escalation (Internal)

Use when: Deal needs resources, pricing approval, or strategic guidance.

```
[Manager],

[Deal Name] ($[value]) needs intervention:
- Root cause: [specific diagnosis]
- Current status: [where things stand]
- What I need: [specific ask -- pricing flexibility, executive
  outreach, SE support]
- Deadline: [when this needs to happen]

Without [specific intervention], this deal will likely slip/die
by [date].
```

---

## When to Walk Away

Not every deal should be rescued. Walking away is a strategic decision, not a failure.

**Walk away when:**

| Signal | Why | Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Buyer's need disappeared | Cannot sell to a need that does not exist | Set 6-month reactivation |
| Product is genuinely wrong fit | Closing creates a churn risk | Refer gracefully, earn long-term trust |
| Economic buyer is hostile | Going around them damages the champion | Withdraw respectfully, check back in 12 months |
| Buyer is using you for leverage | Your proposal is a negotiating chip for their preferred vendor | State directly: "I want to be the choice, not the backup" |
| Deal economics are upside down | Unprofitable deal is worse than no deal | Offer restructured terms or decline |
| Breakup email received no response | The conversation is over | Close as lost, 90-day reminder |
| Rep has invested 3x the normal time | Opportunity cost is too high | Reallocate to active pipeline |

**The disqualification statement**: "The best reps know when to walk away. Closing this deal as lost frees up capacity for deals you can win. A smaller, healthier pipeline outperforms a large, leaky one every time."
