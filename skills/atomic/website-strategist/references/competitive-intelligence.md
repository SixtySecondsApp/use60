## The Leaderboard: What Top AI Tools Do

### Cursor — Pure Product-Led Growth
- **ARR**: $0 → $500M in 21 months
- **Free-to-paid**: 30% (vs typical SaaS 2-5%)
- **Marketing spend**: Zero traditional marketing
- **Hero**: Dark mode, product screenshot (the IDE itself), download CTA
- **Strategy**: The product IS the marketing. Website exists to get you to download.
- **What to steal**: If your product is genuinely good, minimize the landing page. Get people INTO the product.
- **What to skip**: This only works with exceptional product quality + developer audience + word-of-mouth velocity.

### Linear — Design as Differentiator
- **Hero**: Centered, dark background, bold headline, product screenshot below
- **Font**: Inter (on brand for them — engineering tool)
- **Color**: Dark gray/black with purple accent (gradient sphere logo)
- **Layout**: Single-column centered. Reduced cognitive load.
- **Social proof**: Engineering teams at known companies
- **What to steal**: Clean, focused design that mirrors the product's values (fast, clean, no clutter). The website feels like using the product.
- **Lesson**: The website's design should embody your product's core promise.

### v0 (Vercel) — Product-as-Hero
- **Hero**: Text input field right in the hero section. Type a prompt → get a UI component.
- **CTA strategy**: Dual path — input to start building (primary) + "Sign Up" button (secondary)
- **Strategy**: Zero friction between landing and using. The homepage IS the product.
- **What to steal**: If your AI can produce impressive output in < 10 seconds, put the input field in the hero.
- **Conversion insight**: This pattern eliminates the biggest friction — signing up before experiencing value.

### Perplexity — Search Bar as Hero
- **Hero**: Search bar. Ask a question, get an answer. Minimal text.
- **Design**: Clean, smart, sharp. Dark background options.
- **Tech stack**: Marketing pages built in Framer. Ships from idea to live in weeks.
- **LLM traffic**: Perplexity itself converts referral traffic at 10.5%.
- **What to steal**: Framer for marketing pages (speed of iteration). Search/prompt-first hero.

### Runway — Visual Output as Hero
- **Hero**: Full-screen AI-generated video playing as background. Cinematic.
- **Headline**: "Make anything you imagine."
- **CTA**: Dual — "Book a demo" (enterprise) + "See it in action" (self-serve)
- **What to steal**: When your output is visual, let it speak. The hero IS the demo.
- **Lesson**: Dual CTA for dual audience (enterprise + individual).

### Midjourney — Mystery and Community
- **Hero**: Gallery of stunning AI-generated images. Minimal text.
- **CTA**: Discord link (unconventional).
- **Strategy**: Barely has a traditional landing page. Grew through community + word-of-mouth.
- **What to steal**: Nothing (unless you have a massive creative community). Their approach is unique to their situation.
- **Lesson**: The output quality IS the pitch when the output is visual.

### Jasper — Enterprise AI Marketing
- **Hero**: "Create content faster with AI" — benefit-first headline
- **Social proof**: "Trusted by 100,000+ marketers" immediately below hero
- **CTA**: Prominent "Get a Demo" + interactive elements
- **Design**: Professional, bright CTAs on dark background
- **What to steal**: Benefit-first headline + immediate social proof. Classic, proven, works for enterprise.

### ElevenLabs — Try Before You Buy
- **Hero**: Audio samples you can play immediately. Hear the AI voice.
- **Design**: Dark mode, premium positioning
- **What to steal**: Before/after demonstration. Let people experience the output quality before signing up.
- **Hiring signal**: Actively hiring "Landing Page Designers" — heavy investment in landing page optimization.

## Design Trends (2026)

### Dark Mode Default
- **Adoption**: 45% of new AI/SaaS products default to dark
- **Signal**: Modern, technical, premium
- **Who uses it**: Cursor, Linear, Runway, ElevenLabs, v0
- **When to go light**: Consumer-facing, non-technical audience, accessibility priority

### Bento Grid Layouts
- **Adoption**: 67% of SaaS landing pages (up from 25% two years ago)
- **Best for**: Feature sections, use-case showcases
- **Why**: Efficient use of space, modern feel, scannable
- **Rule**: Asymmetric cards (not uniform grid). Vary card sizes for visual hierarchy.

### Glassmorphism
- **Adoption**: Growing, paired with dark mode
- **Effect**: Frosted glass cards, translucent backgrounds, blur effects
- **Best for**: Cards, modals, feature highlights
- **Signal**: Futuristic, premium, AI-native
- **Caution**: Performance-heavy if overused. Use sparingly.

### Micro-Animations
- **Adoption**: Standard — "micro-delight" philosophy dominates
- **Best for**: Loading states, hover effects, scroll-triggered reveals
- **Rule**: Motion should be functional (guide attention, provide feedback), not decorative
- **Performance**: Keep total animation budget under 16ms per frame

## What Makes AI SaaS Sites Different from Traditional SaaS

| Traditional SaaS | AI SaaS |
|-----------------|---------|
| Screenshot hero | Product-as-hero (try it now) |
| "Request a demo" | "Start free" or embedded demo |
| Feature lists | Output showcases (show what the AI produces) |
| Static testimonials | Before/after comparisons |
| Light mode default | Dark mode default |
| 7-day free trial | Freemium with usage limits |
| Sales-led CTA | Product-led CTA |
| "Enterprise-grade security" | "Your data stays yours" |
| Competitor comparison tables | "Works alongside your existing tools" |

### The Key Insight
AI products can show output quality directly. Traditional SaaS has to explain workflow improvements. This is why product-as-hero and output showcase patterns dominate AI landing pages — the proof is in the output.

## Growth Channel Analysis

### How Top AI Tools Drive Signups

| Company | Primary Growth Channel | Supporting Channels |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Cursor | Product virality (developers share) | Twitter/X, dev communities |
| Linear | Word-of-mouth, brand/design reputation | Twitter/X, Product Hunt |
| v0 | Twitter/X virality, Vercel ecosystem | Product Hunt, dev communities |
| Perplexity | SEO (their product IS search), LLM mentions | Social media, press |
| Jasper | Paid ads, content marketing, SEO | Enterprise sales, partnerships |
| Midjourney | Discord community, social media virality | Reddit, Twitter/X |
| Claude/Anthropic | Press, AI researcher community, product quality | Twitter/X, API developers |

### What This Means for 60
- **Primary channel**: Product virality through Slack/email (where users already work)
- **Supporting**: SEO (comparison pages, use-case pages), content marketing, community
- **Not recommended**: Heavy paid acquisition before product-market fit
- **Quick win**: Comparison pages against every CRM/sales tool competitor (highest conversion intent)
