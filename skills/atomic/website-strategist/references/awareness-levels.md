# Audience Awareness Levels

Based on Eugene Schwartz's awareness framework, adapted for AI SaaS. Every page must match the audience's awareness level — what they already know determines what you need to say.

## The 5 Levels

### Level 1: Unaware
**They don't know they have a problem.**

- **Traffic source**: Social media, viral content, brand awareness ads
- **What they need**: Problem education. Make them feel the pain they've been ignoring.
- **Hero approach**: Lead with the problem, not the solution. "You're losing $50K/year to manual follow-ups and you don't even know it."
- **Page length**: Long. You need to build the entire case from scratch.
- **CTA**: Soft. "See how it works" or "Learn more." Not "Start free."
- **Content strategy**: Blog posts, thought leadership, educational content that highlights the problem

**Example**: A founder who does all sales manually and thinks that's normal. They don't know AI sales assistants exist.

### Level 2: Problem-Aware
**They know they have a problem but don't know solutions exist.**

- **Traffic source**: Google searches like "how to follow up with leads faster", "sales admin taking too long"
- **What they need**: Solution education. Show them that the category exists and how it works.
- **Hero approach**: Name their pain, then introduce the solution category. "Stop losing deals to slow follow-ups. AI can handle it in 60 seconds."
- **Page length**: Medium-long. Problem validation + solution introduction + proof.
- **CTA**: Medium. "See it in action" or "Watch demo."
- **Content strategy**: Problem-solution blog posts, how-to guides, "what is [solution category]" pages

**Example**: A founder who knows follow-ups are falling through the cracks but thinks the only solution is hiring a VA or getting more organized.

### Level 3: Solution-Aware
**They know solutions exist but haven't chosen one.**

- **Traffic source**: Google searches like "best AI sales tools", "sales automation software", "[competitor] alternatives"
- **What they need**: Differentiation. Why YOUR solution, not the others?
- **Hero approach**: Lead with your differentiator. "The only AI sales tool that handles everything before AND after the call."
- **Page length**: Medium. Focus on comparison and differentiation.
- **CTA**: Direct. "Start free" or "Try it now."
- **Content strategy**: Comparison pages, alternative pages, feature-focused landing pages

**Example**: A founder who's evaluated 3 competitors and is trying to decide. They know what AI sales tools do — they want to know why THIS one.

### Level 4: Product-Aware
**They know YOUR product but haven't converted yet.**

- **Traffic source**: Direct visits, retargeting ads, email campaigns, word-of-mouth
- **What they need**: Objection handling. Remove the last friction.
- **Hero approach**: Skip the explanation. Go straight to proof and action. "Join 10,000 teams already using 60."
- **Page length**: Short. They know what it does. Address objections and convert.
- **CTA**: Aggressive. "Start free today" with supporting micro-copy ("No credit card required. 2-minute setup.")
- **Content strategy**: Case studies, testimonial pages, pricing clarity, FAQ

**Example**: Someone who saw a demo, read a blog post, or got a recommendation from a friend. They're interested but haven't pulled the trigger.

### Level 5: Most Aware
**They're ready to buy — just need the right offer.**

- **Traffic source**: Pricing page visits, abandoned signup recovery, sales follow-ups
- **What they need**: A clear, compelling offer. No friction.
- **Hero approach**: Offer-led. "Start free. Upgrade when you're ready. Cancel anytime."
- **Page length**: Minimal. Don't over-explain. Get out of the way.
- **CTA**: Maximum urgency with minimum friction.
- **Content strategy**: Pricing page optimization, special offers, time-limited incentives

**Example**: Someone who's visited your pricing page 3 times this week. They want to sign up. Something small is holding them back.

## Awareness Level by Traffic Source

| Traffic Source | Typical Awareness | Strategy |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|

| Google organic (commercial) | Solution-Aware | Differentiate → product-aware |
| Google organic (branded) | Product-Aware | Prove → convert |
| LLM referral (ChatGPT, Perplexity) | Solution-Aware to Product-Aware | These visitors arrive with HIGH context. Convert fast. |
| Social media (organic) | Unaware to Problem-Aware | Hook with problem → educate |
| Social media (paid) | Problem-Aware | Message-match the ad → convert |
| Referral / word-of-mouth | Product-Aware | They already trust the source. Prove and convert. |
| Direct | Product-Aware to Most Aware | Don't over-explain. Fast path to action. |
| Email campaign | Product-Aware | They're on your list. Address objections, convert. |
| Retargeting ad | Product-Aware to Most Aware | They've been here before. Offer-led. |

## How This Affects Page Strategy

### Don't over-educate high-awareness visitors
If someone arrives from ChatGPT with a recommendation, they don't need "What is AI sales automation?" They need "Start free in 60 seconds."

### Don't under-educate low-awareness visitors
If someone finds your blog post via Google, they need to understand the problem before they care about your solution. Jumping to "Sign up now" will lose them.

### Build pages for ONE awareness level
A page that tries to serve Unaware AND Most Aware visitors serves neither. The homepage can serve Solution-Aware to Product-Aware (the middle). Everything else needs targeted pages.

### The homepage defaults to Solution-Aware
Most homepage visitors know solutions exist and are evaluating you. Lead with differentiation, support with proof, convert with low friction.
