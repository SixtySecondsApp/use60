## Pricing Frameworks

### Framework 1: Fixed Price with Tiers

Best for: Defined scope, clients who want budget certainty.

```
Three tiers. Highest first (anchoring). Middle is the target.
Each tier adds clear value. "Best for" helps client self-select.
```

### Framework 2: Hybrid (Fixed + Recurring)

Best for: Projects that include an ongoing service or platform component.

```
Phase 1 (Discovery):     [Amount] (fixed)
Phase 2 (Delivery):      [Amount] (fixed, milestone-based)
Phase 3 (Ongoing):       [Amount]/month (subscription or retainer)
Phase 4 (Support):       [Amount]/month (optional)
```

### Framework 3: T&M with Cap

Best for: Projects with uncertain scope. Gives flexibility with safety.

```
Hourly/daily rate: [Amount]
Estimated range: [Amount] — [Amount]
Hard cap: [Amount] (no charges beyond this without approval)
Billed: Monthly, net-15
```

### Framework 4: Value-Based

Best for: Projects where ROI is clearly quantifiable.

```
Your current [problem] costs approximately [Amount]/year.
Our solution will reduce that by [X]%.

Investment: [Amount] (one-time) + [Amount]/month
Expected ROI: [X]x within [timeframe]
Break-even: [X months]
```
