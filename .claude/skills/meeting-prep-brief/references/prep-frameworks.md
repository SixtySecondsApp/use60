## Why Frameworks Matter

The data on structured preparation is unambiguous:

- **Reps who reference 3+ buyer concerns win 28% more deals** (Gong, 2023 analysis of 1.2M sales calls). Structured prep surfaces these concerns before the meeting starts.
- **Top performers spend 15-30 minutes preparing** vs. 4 minutes for average reps (Salesforce State of Sales). Frameworks compress that 15-30 minutes into consistent, high-quality output.
- **65% of deals that reach advanced stages had a "strong first impression" score** (CSO Insights). The right framework ensures the first impression matches the meeting type.
- **Meetings with a shared agenda have 2.3x higher outcome achievement rates** (Harvard Business Review). Frameworks generate meeting-type-appropriate agendas automatically.

The key insight: preparation is not a single skill. A discovery call requires fundamentally different preparation than a negotiation or QBR. Using the wrong framework -- preparing for a demo when you should be preparing for discovery -- is as damaging as not preparing at all.
