## Why Stakeholder Mapping Matters

The average B2B deal now involves 6-10 decision-makers (Gartner, 2024). Every additional stakeholder increases deal complexity exponentially. Without a map, reps are navigating blind.

Key data points:

- **Deals with a mapped buying committee close at 2.4x the rate** of deals where the committee is unknown (Challenger Inc., 2023).
- **74% of deals stall because a key stakeholder was not engaged** until late in the process (Forrester, 2024). By the time they appear, their objections have hardened.
- **Champions who cannot articulate the business case internally kill 40% of deals** that seemed "won" at the individual level (Gong, 2023). You need to know who your champion is AND equip them.
- **The economic buyer is misidentified in 55% of deals** (TOPO Group). Reps often confuse the person who says "yes" in meetings with the person who signs the check.

Stakeholder mapping is not optional. It is the single most important strategic activity in complex B2B sales.

## The Six Stakeholder Roles

Every buying committee consists of some combination of these six roles. One person may hold multiple roles. Some roles may be held by groups rather than individuals.

### 1. Economic Buyer

**Definition:** The person who controls the budget and has final sign-off authority. They can say "yes" when everyone else says "no."

**Identifying signals:**
- Has a title that includes "VP," "SVP," "C-suite," or "Head of"
- Controls a budget line item that your solution falls under
- Other stakeholders defer to them on financial questions
- They ask about ROI, TCO, payback period, and strategic alignment
- Others say "we need [Name]'s approval" or "[Name] signs off on this"

**Engagement strategy:**
- Speak their language: revenue, margin, risk, competitive advantage
- Present the business case, not the product
- Respect their time: be concise, lead with impact
- Engage through the champion first, then request a direct meeting
- Always have a clear ask: budget approval, timeline commitment, or stakeholder authorization

**Common misconception:** The economic buyer is NOT always the highest-ranking person. In many companies, budget authority is delegated. A Director may control a $500K budget that a VP allocated. The Director is the economic buyer for your deal.

### 2. Champion

**Definition:** An internal advocate who has personal credibility, wants your solution to win, and will sell on your behalf when you are not in the room.

**Identifying signals:**
- Shares internal information voluntarily (org charts, budget cycles, competing priorities)
- Asks how they can help advance the deal
- Offers to set up meetings with other stakeholders
- References conversations they've had internally about your solution
- Has personal motivation: career advancement, team performance, problem resolution

**Champion strength test (all 3 must be true):**
1. **Access:** Can they get meetings with the economic buyer and other decision-makers?
2. **Influence:** Do others respect their opinion and follow their recommendations?
3. **Motivation:** Do they have a personal stake in your solution winning (not just professional interest)?

**Red flags for weak champions:**
- They are enthusiastic but have no authority to introduce you upward
- They say "I love this" but cannot articulate why to their boss
- They have been in their role less than 6 months (limited political capital)
- They avoid committing to specific actions ("I'll see what I can do")

### 3. Influencer

**Definition:** Someone whose opinion shapes the decision but who does not have direct authority. They are often domain experts, respected senior ICs, or team leads.

**Identifying signals:**
- Others reference their opinion: "[Name] thinks..." or "We need [Name]'s input"
- They are brought into evaluation meetings as subject matter experts
- They have technical or operational credibility within the organization
- They may not be in the decision-making chain but their "no" can stall or kill a deal

**Engagement strategy:**
- Validate their expertise: ask for their professional opinion, not just requirements
- Provide them with technical depth and detail (they appreciate rigor)
- Make them look good: give them insights they can share with their team
- Never go around them -- even if they are not "decision-makers," disrespecting their role creates enemies

### 4. Gatekeeper

**Definition:** Someone who controls access to decision-makers or controls a process step (procurement, legal, IT security). They cannot approve a deal, but they can block or delay one indefinitely.

**Identifying signals:**
- Title includes "Procurement," "Vendor Management," "Legal," "Compliance," or "IT Security"
- They focus on process, policy, and compliance rather than value or outcomes
- They ask about contracts, SLAs, data handling, certifications, and vendor risk assessments
- They control the timeline by controlling the approval process

**Engagement strategy:**
- Respect their process completely -- do not try to bypass them
- Be proactive: provide security documentation, compliance certifications, and references before they ask
- Make their job easy: pre-fill vendor questionnaires, provide standard contract redlines
- Do NOT sell to them -- they do not care about your value proposition. They care about risk, compliance, and process

### 5. End User

**Definition:** The person or team who will use your product daily. Their buy-in determines adoption success.

**Identifying signals:**
- They ask about usability, workflow, integrations with their daily tools
- They care about "how does this affect my day-to-day?"
- They may resist change if the current tool is familiar (even if it is inferior)
- Their feedback during demos is the most honest: "that looks complicated" or "that would save me hours"

**Engagement strategy:**
- Demonstrate the product from their perspective (daily workflow, not feature list)
- Quantify time savings in their terms ("saves 4 hours per week" resonates more than "improves efficiency")
- Address change management concerns directly
- Create a pilot program that lets them experience the product risk-free

### 6. Blocker

**Definition:** Someone who actively opposes your solution. They may have rational reasons (legitimate concerns) or political reasons (competing priorities, relationships with competitors, fear of change).

**Identifying signals:**
- They consistently raise objections without offering solutions
- They ask questions designed to disqualify rather than evaluate
- They reference the incumbent solution favorably
- They are noticeably quiet or disengaged during your presentations
- Others warn you about them: "You'll need to get [Name] on board"

**Engagement strategy:**
- Understand their concerns: legitimate objections deserve direct answers
- Engage them early -- the longer you wait, the more entrenched their opposition
- Find common ground: what do they care about that your solution addresses?
- If political, work through the champion to neutralize (not around them -- through the power structure)
- Document their objections and address them in writing so they cannot be repeated endlessly

## MEDDICC Stakeholder Mapping

MEDDICC provides a structured framework for mapping the buying committee. Two letters directly address stakeholder mapping:

### E -- Economic Buyer Identification

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "Who has final budget authority for this purchase?" | Direct identification |
| "What's the approval process for a purchase of this size?" | Process mapping reveals authority |
| "Has your team made a purchase like this before? Who approved it?" | Historical precedent reveals pattern |
| "If your team recommends this, who signs off?" | Maps the chain of command |
| "Is there a budget already allocated, or would this need new approval?" | Budget existence signals authority level |

### C -- Champion Validation

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "How would you describe this solution to your leadership team?" | Tests their ability to sell internally |
| "What would make this a win for you personally?" | Validates personal motivation |
| "Can you walk me through who else needs to weigh in?" | Tests their committee knowledge |
| "Would you be willing to introduce me to [economic buyer]?" | Tests access and willingness |
| "What internal obstacles might we face?" | Tests their candor and strategic awareness |

## Pre-Meeting Stakeholder Research Checklist

Complete this for every attendee before any meeting beyond the first discovery call.

### For Each Known Attendee

| # | Research Item | Source | Time |
|---|-------------|--------|------|
| 1 | Full name and correct pronunciation | LinkedIn, ask champion | 30 sec |
| 2 | Current title and functional area | LinkedIn | 30 sec |
| 3 | Time in current role | LinkedIn | 15 sec |
| 4 | Previous company and role | LinkedIn | 30 sec |
| 5 | Role in the buying decision (from MEDDICC map) | CRM notes | 30 sec |
| 6 | Previous interactions with your company | CRM activity log | 1 min |
| 7 | Known concerns or preferences | Meeting notes, CRM | 1 min |
| 8 | Recent LinkedIn activity (last 3 posts) | LinkedIn | 1 min |
| 9 | Communication style (analytical, driver, amiable, expressive) | Previous interactions | 30 sec |
| 10 | Relationship to other attendees (reports to, peers with) | Org chart, LinkedIn | 30 sec |

### For New / Unknown Attendees

| # | Research Item | Source | Time |
|---|-------------|--------|------|
| 1 | Google "[Name] [Company]" for public content | Google | 1 min |
| 2 | LinkedIn profile review | LinkedIn | 2 min |
| 3 | Ask champion: "Why was [Name] added to this meeting?" | Champion | 1 min |
| 4 | Check CRM for any historical contact | CRM | 30 sec |
| 5 | Hypothesize their role in the buying decision | Analysis | 30 sec |

**New attendee alert:** When a previously unseen person joins a meeting, this is always significant. Possible meanings:
- Positive: A more senior sponsor is engaging (advancement signal)
- Neutral: They are expanding the evaluation team (buying signal, but adds complexity)
- Negative: A new stakeholder is being brought in to challenge or block

Always ask your champion: "I noticed [Name] was added. Can you give me context on their role?"

## Detecting Stakeholder Roles from Behavior

When someone's role is not explicitly stated, their behavior in meetings reveals it.

| Behavior Pattern | Likely Role | Confidence |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Asks about ROI, payback period, total cost | Economic Buyer | High |
| Offers to schedule follow-up meetings with leaders | Champion | High |
| Asks deep technical questions about architecture | Technical Evaluator | High |
| Focuses on compliance, security, vendor risk | Gatekeeper | High |
| Asks about daily workflow and ease of use | End User | High |
| Raises objections without offering alternatives | Blocker | Medium |
| Defers to another person before answering | Lower authority | High |
| Others look to them when a hard question is asked | High influence | High |
| Takes notes actively and asks clarifying questions | Evaluator / Influencer | Medium |
| Stays quiet but was specifically invited | Observer / Silent evaluator | Medium |
| Redirects conversation to a different topic | Potential blocker or misaligned priorities | Medium |
| Says "I need to run this by [Name]" | Not the decision-maker | High |

---

## Multi-Stakeholder Meeting Strategy

When multiple stakeholders attend the same meeting, adjust your approach.

### Meeting Size Guidelines

| Attendees | Complexity | Strategy |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| 1-2 | Low | Standard prep, focus on individual |
| 3-4 | Medium | Know each person's role, balance airtime |
| 5-7 | High | Committee meeting: need an agenda, address each role |
| 8+ | Very High | Presentation format, focus on top 3 stakeholders |

### Airtime Allocation

- **Economic buyer:** 30% of your attention. They set the tone.
- **Champion:** 20%. They validate and support your points.
- **Strongest objector/blocker:** 20%. Addressing their concerns publicly is powerful.
- **Others:** Split the remaining 30% proportionally.

### Dangerous Dynamics to Watch For

| Dynamic | Risk | Response |
|---------|------|----------|
| Two stakeholders openly disagree | Shows internal misalignment | Acknowledge both perspectives, do not pick sides |
| Economic buyer arrives late or leaves early | Your deal may not be a priority | Deliver your key message in the first 5 minutes |
| New person asks aggressive questions | Potential late-stage blocker | Welcome the questions, answer with data, follow up 1:1 |
| Champion is uncharacteristically quiet | Champion may have received internal pressure | Check in with champion privately after the meeting |
| Everyone defers to one person who isn't the stated lead | Real power differs from org chart | Identify the de facto decision-maker and adjust |

---

## Common Stakeholder Mapping Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Assuming title = authority | Waste time selling to someone who cannot approve | Ask: "Who signs off on this?" |
| Relying on a single champion | Deal dies if champion leaves, changes roles, or loses credibility | Develop 2-3 internal supporters |
| Ignoring gatekeepers | Procurement or legal delays kill deal momentum at the worst time | Engage procurement early, proactively share documentation |
| Not re-mapping after org changes | New leadership may reset priorities and vendor relationships | Monitor LinkedIn for job changes at prospect company |
| Assuming silence = agreement | Quiet stakeholders may be the strongest opponents | Directly ask quiet attendees for their perspective |
| Mapping only the people you've met | Missing the person who has not attended a meeting but holds veto power | Ask: "Is there anyone else who needs to weigh in?" |
