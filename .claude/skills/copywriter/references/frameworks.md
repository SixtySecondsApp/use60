## Conversion Frameworks

### AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)
**When:** Cold audiences with low awareness. Product launches. First-time visitors.

- **Attention:** Bold headline that stops the scroll. Specific, benefit-driven, curiosity-inducing.
- **Interest:** Relevant facts, data, or stories that make them lean in.
- **Desire:** Shift from logic to emotion. Show transformation, paint the "after" picture. Social proof.
- **Action:** Single, clear CTA. Verb-first. State what they GET, not what they DO.

**Example (Landing Page Hero):**
```
[Attention] Your sales team is leaving $2.4M on the table every quarter.

[Interest] We analyzed 50,000 deals and found that 68% of lost opportunities
had one thing in common: no follow-up within 48 hours.

[Desire] Teams using 60 close 40% more deals because the AI follows up
before the prospect goes cold. Imagine opening your CRM on Monday and
seeing 12 new replies from deals you thought were dead.

[Action] Start your free trial — see your first win this week.

### PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)
**When:** Audience knows they have a problem but hasn't found a solution. The single most effective framework for conversion copy in 2024-2025.

- **Problem:** Name the specific pain the reader is experiencing. Use their language.
- **Agitate:** Twist the knife. What happens if they don't fix this? Make them FEEL the cost.
- **Solution:** Present your product as the relief. Be specific about the outcome.

**Example (Sales Page Section):**
```
[Problem] Your reps spend 3 hours a day on manual data entry instead of
selling. That's 15 hours a week. Per rep.

[Agitate] Multiply that across your team of 10. That's 150 hours of
selling time evaporating every week. At $500/hour in potential pipeline
value, you're burning $75,000 a week. And your best reps? They're the
ones most likely to quit over it.

[Solution] 60 eliminates manual entry entirely. Every call, email, and
meeting is automatically logged, summarized, and connected to the right
deal. Your reps sell. The AI does the rest. Teams see 40% more selling
time in the first month.
```

### BAB (Before → After → Bridge)
**When:** Clear transformation story. Testimonial-driven pages. Case studies.

- **Before:** Describe the reader's current painful reality in vivid detail.
- **After:** Paint the picture of life after the problem is solved. Make it specific and desirable.
- **Bridge:** Your product is the bridge from Before to After.

**Example (Email):**
```
[Before] Right now, you're prepping for meetings by frantically searching
through old emails and CRM notes 10 minutes before the call. You walk in
half-prepared and miss the context that would close the deal.

[After] What if every meeting started with a one-page brief — who they
are, what they care about, what they said last time, and exactly what to
say to move the deal forward?

[Bridge] That's what 60's Meeting Prep Brief does. It reads your entire
deal history and generates a prep doc in 30 seconds. 3,200 reps already
use it. Most say it's the feature they'd miss most.
```

### 4Ps (Promise → Picture → Proof → Push)
**When:** Sales pages, product descriptions, long-form landing pages.

- **Promise:** Make a bold, specific, benefit-driven claim.
- **Picture:** Paint a vivid mental image using sensory language.
- **Proof:** Back it up with hard evidence.
- **Push:** Create urgency and deliver a clear CTA.

**Example (Product Section):**
```
[Promise] Close 40% more deals without hiring another rep.

[Picture] It's Friday afternoon. You open your pipeline and every deal
has a health score, a recommended next step, and a follow-up already
drafted. Your team spent zero minutes on admin this week. They just sold.

[Proof] Acme Corp added $1.2M in closed-won revenue in 90 days after
switching. Their VP of Sales said: "It's like having 3 extra SDRs who
never call in sick."

card required.

### PASTOR (Problem → Amplify → Solution → Transformation → Offer → Response)
**When:** Long-form sales pages. High-ticket products. Webinar pitches. VSLs.

This is the most comprehensive framework. Use it when you have space and need to build deep conviction.

- **Problem:** Identify the core pain. Be specific and empathetic.
- **Amplify:** Magnify the consequences. Financial cost, emotional toll, opportunity cost.
- **Solution:** Present your answer with credibility and authority.
- **Transformation:** Show the before/after with specific outcomes. Customer stories.
- **Offer:** Detail exactly what they get. Features as benefits. Bonuses. Guarantee.
- **Response:** Remove all friction. Tell them exactly how to buy. Handle final objections.

---

### ACCA (Awareness → Comprehension → Conviction → Action)
**When:** Complex products. B2B with technical audiences. Enterprise sales pages.

- **Awareness:** Make the reader aware of a problem or opportunity they may not see.
- **Comprehension:** Help them understand the nature of the problem AND your solution.
- **Conviction:** Build belief through evidence. Multiple proof types.
- **Action:** Clear, low-friction next step.

**Example (Enterprise Landing Page):**
```
[Awareness] 73% of enterprise sales teams can't answer this question:
"Which deals in your pipeline will actually close this quarter?"

[Comprehension] The problem isn't your CRM. It's that your CRM only knows
what reps type into it. It doesn't know what was said in meetings, what
the buyer's real objections are, or whether the champion is still engaged.

[Conviction] 60 listens to every meeting, reads every email thread, and
scores every deal on 14 health indicators. In a blind study with 200
companies, our predictions were 3.2x more accurate than rep forecasts.

## Storytelling Frameworks

### Star-Story-Solution
**When:** Founder-led brands. About pages. Origin stories. Info products.

- **Star:** Introduce the protagonist (founder, customer, user).
- **Story:** Tell the journey — struggle, discovery, turning point.
- **Solution:** Reveal how they arrived at the result (your product/service).

### Customer Mirror
**When:** Case studies. Testimonial sections. "People like you" proof.

**Structure:** Describe a situation identical to the reader's → Show what changed → Reveal it was your product.

**Example:**
```
A VP of Sales at a 50-person SaaS company was losing 30% of deals to
"no decision." His team was doing everything right — great demos, strong
follow-ups — but deals kept dying in committee.

He started using 60's stakeholder mapping. Within 2 weeks he could see
every person involved in a decision, what they cared about, and who was
blocking. Three months later, his "no decision" rate dropped to 11%.

Sound familiar?
```

### Tension-Resolution
**When:** Brand manifestos. Video scripts. Emotional marketing.

**Structure:** What's wrong with the world → What it should be → How we get there.

---

## Education & Authority Frameworks

### Point-Evidence-Action (PEA)
**When:** Thought leadership posts. LinkedIn. Blog articles. Op-eds.

- **Point:** State a clear, specific opinion. Be direct. Don't hedge.
- **Evidence:** Back it up with data, experience, examples, or stories.
- **Action:** Give the reader something specific they can do with this insight.

**Example (LinkedIn Post):**
```
[Point] The best sales teams in 2026 don't have the most reps.
They have the best data.

[Evidence] I spent 6 months studying teams that doubled revenue without
hiring. The pattern: they all invested in meeting intelligence before
headcount. One team (40 reps) outperformed a competitor with 120 reps
because they knew exactly which deals to focus on.

[Action] If you're planning headcount for next quarter, run this test
first: score every deal in your pipeline on 3 criteria — champion
engagement, decision timeline, and budget confirmation. I bet 30% of
your "pipeline" evaporates. Fix that before you hire.
```

### QUEST (Qualify → Understand → Educate → Stimulate → Transition)
**When:** Content marketing. Webinar scripts. Lead magnets. Educational funnels.

- **Qualify:** Make it immediately clear who this is for. "If you're a..."
- **Understand:** Demonstrate empathy. Show you know their world.
- **Educate:** Teach something valuable. Build authority.
- **Stimulate:** Create excitement and desire for the outcome.
- **Transition:** Guide smoothly into the CTA.

## Compressed Frameworks

### PAS Compressed (for ads)
**Structure in 3 lines:**
Line 1: Pain point (specific)
Line 2: Consequence or agitation (emotional)
Line 3: Solution + CTA

**Example (Meta Ad):**
```
Your reps spend more time on admin than selling.
That's $75K/week walking out the door.
60 eliminates manual data entry. Start free ->
```

### BAB Compressed (for ads)
**Structure:**
Line 1: Current state (pain)
Line 2: Future state (desire)
Line 3: Your product is the bridge + CTA

### Question-Proof-CTA (for ads)
**Structure:**
Line 1: Question that hits a nerve
Line 2: One line of social proof
Line 3: CTA

**Example (LinkedIn Ad):**
```
Can your CRM predict which deals will close this quarter?
Ours was 3.2x more accurate than rep forecasts in a 200-company study.

## Hybrid Patterns

Elite copywriters hybridize frameworks. Common combinations:

### PAS Hook → AIDA Body → CTA Close
Use PAS for the opening hook (landing page hero), then AIDA for the body sections, and close with a strong CTA section.

### QUEST for Content → PAS for Conversion
Use QUEST structure for educational blog content. Switch to PAS for the conversion CTA section at the bottom.

### Star-Story-Solution → BAB → Social Proof → ACCA Close
Founder story opener → Before/After transformation → Testimonials → Logical conviction → Action. The full persuasion stack for sales pages.

### Point-Evidence-Action × 3 → CTA
Three PEA sections, each making a different point that builds on the last. Then a single conversion CTA. Perfect for thought leadership that sells.
