# Headlines & Hooks

"On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar." — David Ogilvy

## The Headline Formula

**Great Headline = Benefit + Specificity + Curiosity**

A headline must do at least ONE of these:
1. Promise a benefit
2. Deliver news or a fresh insight
3. Arouse curiosity
4. Name the audience

The best headlines do 2-3 simultaneously.

## Headline Writing Rules

1. **Write 25 headlines before picking one.** Ogilvy wrote 104 for a single ad. Your first headline is never your best.

2. **Front-load the benefit.** Readers scan from left to right. If the benefit is at the end of a 15-word headline, most people never reach it.

3. **Use numbers when possible.** "3 Ways" outperforms "Several Ways." "47% More" outperforms "Significantly More." Specificity = credibility.

4. **Odd numbers outperform even numbers.** 7 beats 6. 11 beats 10. 3 beats 4. They feel less manufactured.

5. **Under 10 words for maximum readership.** Ogilvy's data showed longer headlines get less attention. Say more with less.

6. **Never sacrifice clarity for cleverness.** Puns, wordplay, and inside jokes amuse the writer but confuse the reader. If someone can't understand the headline in 2 seconds, rewrite it.

7. **The headline should work without the body copy.** If the headline alone doesn't communicate the core message, it's too dependent on context.

8. **Test the "bar test."** Would someone lean in if you said this headline out loud at a bar? If not, it's too boring or too corporate.
