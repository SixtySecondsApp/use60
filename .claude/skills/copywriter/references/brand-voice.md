# Brand Voice & Tone Framework

A complete guide for defining, documenting, and maintaining brand voice across all copy.

---

## Voice vs. Tone

**Voice** = Your brand's consistent personality. WHO you are. Does not change.
**Tone** = How that personality adapts to context. Changes based on audience, channel, and situation.

Analogy: Your voice is your personality. Your tone changes when talking to your manager vs. your best friend, but you're still you.

## Step 1: Define Voice Attributes

Select 3-4 core attributes from these dimensions:

| Dimension | Spectrum |
|-----------|----------|
| Formality | Casual ←→ Formal |
| Humor | Serious ←→ Playful |
| Energy | Calm ←→ Enthusiastic |
| Authority | Peer-level ←→ Expert |
| Warmth | Clinical ←→ Empathetic |
| Boldness | Conservative ←→ Provocative |
| Complexity | Simple ←→ Technical |
| Personality | Reserved ←→ Expressive |

**Output:** "We are [attribute 1], [attribute 2], [attribute 3], and [attribute 4]."

Example: "We are **confident**, **direct**, **warm**, and **slightly irreverent**."

## Step 2: Create "We Are / We Are Not" Pairs

This is the most useful tool for maintaining consistency. Writers refer to this constantly.

| We ARE | We are NOT |
|--------|------------|
| Confident but not arrogant | Stiff or corporate |
| Direct but not blunt | Vague or wishy-washy |
| Warm but not saccharine | Cold or detached |
| Expert but not condescending | Dumbed-down or preachy |
| Witty but not trying too hard | Cringe or forced |
| Opinionated but not closed-minded | Neutral or fence-sitting |
| Conversational but not sloppy | Overly polished or robotic |
| Bold but not reckless | Timid or hedge-everything |

**Template for your brand:**
```
We ARE:
- [Positive trait] but not [negative extreme]
- [Positive trait] but not [negative extreme]
- [Positive trait] but not [negative extreme]
- [Positive trait] but not [negative extreme]

We are NOT:
- [Negative trait to avoid]
- [Negative trait to avoid]
- [Negative trait to avoid]
- [Negative trait to avoid]
```

## Step 3: Build the Tone Matrix

Map how your voice adapts across channels and contexts:

| Context | Formality | Humor | Energy | Example |
|---------|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| Website hero | Medium | Light | High | "Close more deals. Stress less." |
| Product description | Medium | None | Medium | "Auto-logs every call, email, and meeting to your CRM." |
| Social media | Low | High | High | "Your pipeline called. It misses you." |
| Sales email | Medium | Low | Medium | "Here's how 3 teams cut close time by 40%." |
| Support reply | Low | None | Calm | "I see the issue. Here's the fix." |
| Blog post | Medium | Medium | Medium | "Most sales teams waste 5 hours/week on meeting prep. Here's the fix." |
| Error message | Low | Light | Calm | "Something went sideways. We're looking into it." |
| Pricing page | Medium | None | Medium | "Simple pricing. No surprises." |
| Case study | Medium | None | Medium | "Acme Corp closed 40% more deals in 90 days." |
| Board/investor | High | None | Medium | "Q4 pipeline velocity increased 23% YoY." |
| Onboarding | Low | Light | High | "You're in! Let's get you set up in 4 minutes." |
| Win announcement | Low | Medium | High | "Another one! [Company] just went live." |
| Churn save | Medium | None | Empathetic | "We don't want to see you go. What can we fix?" |

## Step 4: Word Lists

### Words We Always Use
Build a list of 15-20 words that feel like your brand:

**Example for a B2B SaaS:**
- Pipeline, deals, reps, close, revenue
- Smart, fast, automatic, simple
- Actually, really (conversational emphasis)
- Built for, designed for, made for
- Your team, your reps (second person)

### Words We Never Use
Build a list of words that DON'T sound like your brand:

**Example:**
- Leverage, utilize, optimize, streamline (corporate jargon)
- Cutting-edge, best-in-class, world-class, state-of-the-art (empty superlatives)
- Empower, elevate, revolutionize, transform (overused verbs)
- Ecosystem, enablement, operationalize (consulting-speak)
- Synergy, paradigm, disrupt (Silicon Valley cliches)

### Phrase Preferences
| Instead of... | We say... |
|---------------|-----------|
| "Get started today" | "Start free" or "Try it" |
| "Schedule a demo" | "See it in action" |
| "Learn more" | "See how it works" |
| "Contact sales" | "Talk to us" |
| "Request a quote" | "Get pricing" |
| "Our comprehensive platform" | "Everything you need to [goal]" |
| "We're excited to announce" | "New: [thing]" or "Just shipped: [thing]" |
| "Don't hesitate to reach out" | "Questions? [channel]" |

## Step 5: Voice Consistency Rules

### Grammar & Style Choices
Document these so all writers are aligned:

| Decision | Options | Your Choice |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Oxford comma | Always / Never / Context-dependent | |
| Contractions | Always / Never / Mostly | |
| Sentence fragments | OK / Avoid | |
| Starting with "And" / "But" | OK / Avoid | |
| Exclamation marks | Sparingly / Never / Freely | |
| Em dashes | Use / Avoid (AI tell) | |
| Emoji in copy | Never / Sparingly / Freely | |
| Numbers | Spell out <10 / Always digits / Always spell out | |
| "You" vs "Your team" | Direct / Inclusive | |
| First person | "I" / "We" / Varies by channel | |

### Punctuation Personality
Punctuation carries tone. Document preferences:

- **Periods.** Authoritative. Final. Confident.
- **Ellipsis...** Builds suspense. Can feel hesitant if overused.
- **Dashes -** Casual pause. Conversational.
- **Question marks?** Engaging. Interactive. Good for hooks.
- **Exclamation marks!** Use MAX once per page/email. Never in headlines.
- **Parentheses (like this)** Aside. Informal. Feels like a wink.

## Brand Voice Audit Checklist

When reviewing existing copy for voice consistency:

- [ ] Does this sound like ONE person wrote it? (Or do different pages sound different?)
- [ ] Could you identify the brand from the copy alone (without the logo)?
- [ ] Are the "We Are / We Are Not" pairs respected?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for the channel? (Tone matrix alignment)
- [ ] Are any dead-language phrases present? (Check anti-slop.md)
- [ ] Do the word list preferences hold? (No banned words used)
- [ ] Is the formality level consistent within each channel?
- [ ] Does the copy pass the "coffee shop test"?
- [ ] Would a new writer be able to match this voice using the voice doc alone?

## Delivering a Brand Voice Document

When a user asks you to define their brand voice, deliver:

1. **Voice Summary** — 2-3 sentence description of the brand personality
2. **Voice Attributes** — 3-4 core attributes with definitions
3. **We Are / We Are Not** — 4-6 pairs
4. **Tone Matrix** — At least 6 channels with examples
5. **Word Lists** — Always use (15-20), Never use (15-20), Phrase preferences (10+)
6. **Grammar & Style Choices** — Documented decisions
7. **3 Example Rewrites** — Take generic copy and rewrite it in the brand voice
8. **Voice Test** — 5 sample scenarios with "on-brand" and "off-brand" examples

This document becomes the single source of truth for all copy across the organization.
