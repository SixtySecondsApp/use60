## Eugene Schwartz's 5 Levels of Awareness

The most important framework for deciding WHAT to say. Match your copy to the reader's current awareness level.

| Level | What They Know | Your Job | Copy Approach |
|-------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **1. Unaware** | Don't know they have a problem | Create awareness | Lead with a story or provocative question. Don't sell yet |
| **2. Problem-Aware** | Know the pain, not the solution | Agitate and present | PAS framework. Name the pain, make it vivid, introduce the category |
| **3. Solution-Aware** | Know solutions exist, don't know you | Differentiate | Show why you're different. Comparison, unique mechanism, proof |
| **4. Product-Aware** | Know you, haven't converted | Overcome objections | Proof, guarantees, urgency, testimonials, risk reversal |
| **5. Most Aware** | Ready to buy, need a reason NOW | Make it easy | Direct offer, discount, bonus, deadline. Get out of the way |

**Critical Rule:** Never sell to Level 1 like they're Level 5. If someone doesn't know they have a problem, a discount code is meaningless.

## Cialdini's 7 Principles of Persuasion

### 1. Reciprocity
People feel obligated to return favors. Give value first — free tools, guides, templates, insights — before asking for anything.

**In copy:**
- Lead magnets: "Get the free playbook" before "Buy the course"
- Content marketing: 90% teaching, 10% selling
- Free trials: let them experience the value before paying
- "Here's what we found..." before "Here's what we sell"

### 2. Commitment & Consistency
Once someone takes a small action, they're more likely to take larger consistent actions.

**In copy:**
- Micro-commitments: quiz → email → free trial → paid
- "Yes" ladders: ask questions they'll say yes to before the big ask
- Interactive elements: calculators, assessments, configurators
- "You're already [doing X], so [next step] is the natural next move"

### 3. Social Proof
People follow the crowd. The most universally powerful principle.

**In copy:**
- User counts: "Join 10,000+ teams"
- Testimonials: specific results from real people with real names
- Logo bars: recognizable company logos
- Ratings: "4.9/5 from 2,300 reviews"
- "Most popular" badges on pricing tiers
- Case studies with specific metrics
- Real-time activity: "Sarah from Austin just signed up"

**Social proof hierarchy (strongest to weakest):**
1. Specific results from named customers in your audience's industry
2. Aggregate data ("10,000 teams" or "4.9/5 rating")
3. Expert endorsements or press mentions
4. Logo bars of recognizable companies
5. Generic testimonials without specifics

### 4. Authority
People defer to experts and credible sources.

**In copy:**
- Credentials and certifications
- Press mentions: "As featured in..."
- Data citations: "According to our analysis of 50,000 deals..."
- Expert endorsements
- Published research or original data
- "Trusted by" sections with enterprise logos
- Author bios with relevant credentials

### 5. Liking
People say yes to those they like. Similarity, compliments, and familiarity drive liking.

**In copy:**
- Relatable brand voice: write like a smart friend, not a corporation
- Shared values: "We believe sales should be about relationships, not spreadsheets"
- Founder story: humanize the brand
- Customer stories: "People like you"
- Humor (when appropriate): a genuinely funny line builds instant rapport

### 6. Scarcity
People value what is rare or diminishing. Loss aversion means we fear losing 2x more than we desire gaining.

**In copy:**
- Limited-time offers: "Pricing increases Friday"
- Capacity limits: "Only 50 spots in the beta"
- Countdown timers (only when genuine)
- "Early bird" or "founding member" pricing
- "X spots remaining"

**CRITICAL: Never use fake scarcity.** Audiences see through it instantly and trust collapses permanently. If it's not genuinely limited, don't pretend it is.

### 7. Unity
People are influenced by those in their in-group. Shared identity is a powerful motivator.

**In copy:**
- "For founders, by founders"
- "Built by sales teams who were tired of..."
- Tribal language: "We're the revenue team's secret weapon"
- Community: "Join the community of..."
- Insider language that signals belonging

## Key Cognitive Biases for Copywriters

### Loss Aversion
Losses feel ~2x stronger than equivalent gains.

- "Don't lose $75K/week to manual data entry" > "Save $75K/week"
- "Don't miss your window" > "Take advantage of this opportunity"
- "Your competitors already know this" > "Learn what the best teams do"

### Anchoring
The first number seen sets expectations for all subsequent numbers.

- Show higher price first, then the actual price: "~~$299~~ $149/mo"
- Reference the cost of the problem before the cost of the solution
- "Companies spend $500K/year on tools that don't talk to each other. 60 replaces them all for $149/mo."

### Framing Effect
How you present information changes perception.

- "95% uptime" vs "5% downtime" (same fact, different feeling)
- "Join 10,000 teams" vs "Don't be one of the teams still doing this manually"
- "Save 15 hours/week" vs "Get 15 hours back every week"

### Decoy Effect
A third option makes the target option look better.

**Pricing page example:**
- Basic: $29 (too limited)
- Pro: $79 (the target — best value)
- Enterprise: $299 (makes Pro look affordable)

The middle tier should have dramatically more value than Basic, and the jump to Enterprise should feel disproportionate. This makes Pro the "obvious" choice.

### Paradox of Choice
Too many options cause decision paralysis.

- Maximum 3 pricing tiers
- One primary CTA per page section
- "We recommend..." reduces cognitive load
- Remove options that don't serve the primary conversion goal

### Endowment Effect
People overvalue what they already "own."

- Free trials: "Your account is ready" (they already "own" it)
- Personalized demos: "Here's YOUR pipeline scored" (it's already theirs)
- Progress indicators: "You're 80% done setting up" (don't abandon what you started)

### Status Quo Bias
People prefer the current state and resist change.

- Reframe inaction as a choice: "Doing nothing costs you $75K/week"
- Make switching easy: "Import from your existing CRM in one click"
- Reduce perceived risk: "Cancel anytime. No contracts."

### Confirmation Bias
People seek information that confirms existing beliefs.

- Lead with beliefs your audience already holds: "You already know that sales is a relationship game..."
- Position your product as the logical extension of what they believe
- Don't try to change deeply held beliefs — align with them

### FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
Fear of being excluded from an opportunity.

- "Limited beta access"
- "Your competitors are already using this"
- "Join before pricing increases"
- Show what peers are doing that they're not

## Emotional Triggers in Copy

### The 4 Core Motivators (PIES)
Every purchase decision is driven by one or more of these:

| Motivator | What It Means | Copy Angle |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Power** | Control, status, dominance | "Take control of your pipeline" |
| **Identity** | Who they want to be | "The tool smart revenue teams use" |
| **Emotion** | How they want to feel | "Imagine walking into Monday knowing every deal is on track" |
| **Safety** | Risk reduction, security | "Never lose a deal to dropped follow-up again" |

### Fear vs. Aspiration
Both work. Use the right one for the right audience.

**Fear-based (Problem-Aware audiences):**
"Your pipeline has a $2M leak. Here's where it's bleeding."

**Aspiration-based (Solution-Aware audiences):**
"The best sales teams close 40% more because they know something you don't."

**Rule of thumb:** Fear for opening (gets attention). Aspiration for closing (drives action). Don't close on fear — it creates buyer's remorse.

## The Psychology Ranking for Copy

When writing or reviewing, these principles ranked by impact:

1. **Relevance** — Is this specifically about THEM and THEIR reality right now?
2. **Cognitive ease** — Can they process and act in under 10 seconds?
3. **Curiosity** — Did you open a gap they need to close?
4. **Specificity** — Numbers, names, and concrete details over adjectives
5. **Social proof** — Are their peers doing this?
6. **Authority** — Why should they trust you?
7. **Loss framing** — Are they losing something by not acting?
8. **Reciprocity** — Did you give value first?

The best copy nails the top 4-5. Trying to use all 8 produces bloated, over-engineered work.
