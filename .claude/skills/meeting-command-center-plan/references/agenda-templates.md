## Agenda Design Principles

Research consistently shows that structured agendas produce better meeting outcomes:

- **Meetings with shared agendas complete 2.3x more action items** than unstructured meetings (Harvard Business Review, 2022).
- **67% of meetings with more than 3 core discussion topics fail to resolve any of them** (McKinsey, 2023). Fewer topics, deeper discussion.
- **The last 5 minutes of a meeting are the most important.** Deals that include a "next steps" close convert at 28% higher rates than those that trail off (Gong, 2023).
- **Sharing the agenda 24+ hours in advance** increases participant preparation by 40% and meeting satisfaction by 35% (Microsoft WorkLab, 2024).

### The 5 Rules of Effective Agendas

1. **Every item has an outcome.** "Discuss pricing" is a topic. "Agree on pricing structure" is an outcome.
2. **Maximum 3 core discussion items.** Time-box each one. If you have 5 topics, cut 2 or schedule a second meeting.
3. **Always start with alignment.** Confirm the agenda, the time, and the purpose. Misaligned expectations waste entire meetings.
4. **Always end with next steps.** Never cut the close. If you run short on time, cut a discussion topic instead.
5. **Assign owners to each section.** Who leads the discussion? Who presents? This prevents awkward silences and crosstalk.

## Discovery Call Agenda (45 minutes)

**Purpose:** Understand the prospect's current state, pain points, and buying landscape.
**Share Agenda:** No (discovery is best when conversational, not rigidly structured). Use as internal guide.
**Key Rule:** The prospect should talk 70%+ of the time.

### Full Template

```
DISCOVERY CALL AGENDA
Meeting: [Title]
Date: [Date] | Time: 45 minutes
Attendees: [Names and titles]
Meeting Owner: [Your name]

1. INTRODUCTIONS & AGENDA CONFIRMATION (3 min)
   Owner: You
   Outcome: Mutual understanding of who's in the room and what we'll cover
   Script: "Thanks for making time today. I'd like to spend most of our
   time understanding your situation and priorities. I'll ask questions,
   and at the end we can decide if there's a logical next step. Sound good?"

2. THEIR WORLD: CURRENT STATE (12 min)
   Owner: Prospect (you facilitate)
   Outcome: Clear picture of how they currently handle [relevant process]
   Key Questions:
   - "Walk me through how your team currently handles [X]."
   - "How many people are involved in that process?"
   - "What tools or systems do you use for this today?"
   Facilitation Note: Let them talk. Resist the urge to pitch.
   Take notes on specific pain language they use.

3. PAIN EXPLORATION: WHAT'S NOT WORKING (12 min)
   Owner: Prospect (you facilitate)
   Outcome: 2-3 quantified pain points with business impact
   Key Questions:
   - "What happens when that process breaks down?"
   - "How does that affect [revenue/team/timeline/customers]?"
   - "If you could fix one thing about [current process], what would it be?"
   Facilitation Note: Use "why behind the why" technique.
   Go 2-3 questions deep on each pain.

4. PRIORITIES & TIMELINE (8 min)
   Owner: You
   Outcome: Understand where this ranks and who else is involved
   Key Questions:
   - "Where does solving this rank among your priorities this quarter?"
   - "Have you tried to solve this before? What happened?"
   - "Who else would need to be involved in evaluating a solution?"
   Facilitation Note: This is where you qualify. If it's not a
   priority, better to know now.

5. BRIEF CONTEXT (5 min)
   Owner: You
   Outcome: Prospect understands what you do (at a high level only)
   Script: "Based on what you've shared, here's a 30-second overview
   of how we help teams like yours with [their pain]."
   Rule: 30-60 seconds MAX. This is not a pitch. It's a bridge
   to the next step.

6. NEXT STEPS (5 min)
   Owner: You
   Outcome: Agreed-upon follow-up action with a date
   Options:
   - "Based on what you've shared, a 30-minute demo focused on [pain]
     would make sense. How does [date/time] look?"
   - "I think the next step would be [specific action]. Does that
     align with how you're thinking about this?"
   Rule: Never end with "I'll follow up." End with a specific action
   and a specific date.
```

### Facilitator Notes

- If the prospect takes control and starts asking about your product early, redirect gently: "Great question -- I want to make sure I show you the most relevant parts. Can I ask a couple more questions first?"
- If a new attendee joins unexpectedly, pause for a 30-second introduction round before continuing.
- If the prospect is giving short answers, try the "that's interesting, tell me more about..." prompt to draw them out.

---

## Product Demo Agenda (30 minutes)

**Purpose:** Show the prospect their future state, validate solution fit, and advance to evaluation or proposal.
**Share Agenda:** Yes, 24 hours before. Let them add topics.
**Key Rule:** Never demo features they did not ask about. Only demo to their pain.

### Full Template

```
PRODUCT DEMO AGENDA
Meeting: [Title]
Date: [Date] | Time: 30 minutes
Attendees: [Names and titles]
Meeting Owner: [Your name]
Pre-Read Sent: [Yes/No, with link to agenda email]

1. RECAP & ALIGNMENT (5 min)
   Owner: You
   Outcome: Confirm pain points are still accurate and set demo context
   Script: "Last time we spoke, you mentioned three main challenges:
   [Pain 1], [Pain 2], and [Pain 3]. Are those still your top
   priorities, or has anything changed?"
   Facilitation Note: If priorities have shifted, adjust the demo
   on the fly. A demo that doesn't match their current pain is
   worse than no demo.

2. SOLUTION WALKTHROUGH (15 min)
   Owner: You (with questions from prospect)
   Outcome: Prospect sees how each pain is addressed, in their context
   Structure:
   - Pain 1 -> Feature A -> "Here's how this solves [their specific words]" (5 min)
   - Pain 2 -> Feature B -> "This addresses [their concern about X]" (5 min)
   - Pain 3 -> Feature C -> "And for [their third priority]..." (5 min)
   Facilitation Note: After each section, pause and ask:
   "Does this address what you described?" Get micro-confirmations.
   If they light up on one feature, spend more time there. Drop a
   lower-priority feature if needed.

3. QUESTIONS & TECHNICAL DISCUSSION (5 min)
   Owner: Prospect
   Outcome: Surface technical concerns, integration needs, adoption questions
   Prompt: "What questions do you have? Is there anything I didn't
   cover that you'd need to see?"
   Facilitation Note: Technical questions are buying signals. The
   prospect is imagining implementation. Answer clearly and offer
   to send detailed documentation.

4. NEXT STEPS & EVALUATION CRITERIA (5 min)
   Owner: You
   Outcome: Agree on evaluation criteria, timeline, and next meeting
   Questions:
   - "What evaluation criteria are most important to your team?"
   - "Who else needs to be involved before you can move forward?"
   - "What timeline are you working toward?"
   Script: "Based on today, I'd suggest [specific next step] as the
   logical next move. I can have [deliverable] to you by [date].
   Does [specific date/time] work for a follow-up?"
```

## Quarterly Business Review Agenda (60 minutes)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate value delivered, align on next quarter goals, and identify expansion opportunities.
**Share Agenda:** Yes, 48 hours before. Include a pre-read with usage data and metrics.
**Key Rule:** Lead with their success, not your product.

### Full Template

```
QUARTERLY BUSINESS REVIEW AGENDA
Meeting: Q[X] Business Review -- [Company Name]
Date: [Date] | Time: 60 minutes
Attendees: [Customer stakeholders] + [Your team]
Meeting Owner: [CSM/AM name]
Pre-Read: [Link to QBR deck or data summary]

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (5 min)
   Owner: Account Manager / CSM
   Outcome: Everyone aligned on the "headline" for this quarter
   Format: One slide with 3 numbers:
   - Key outcome metric (e.g., "47% reduction in manual data entry")
   - Adoption metric (e.g., "186 active users, up from 120")
   - ROI metric (e.g., "$340K estimated annual savings")
   Facilitation Note: Start strong. The executive summary sets the
   tone. If the numbers are good, lead with them. If mixed, frame
   as "progress with opportunities."

2. USAGE & ADOPTION DEEP DIVE (15 min)
   Owner: CSM
   Outcome: Shared understanding of how the product is being used
   Cover:
   - Active users vs. licensed users (adoption rate)
   - Most-used features and workflows
   - Usage trends (growing, flat, declining)
   - Benchmark comparison (how they compare to similar customers)
   Facilitation Note: Have specific user stories ready.
   "Your SDR team in EMEA is using [feature] 3x more than last
   quarter" is more powerful than aggregate numbers.

3. SUCCESS STORIES & WINS (10 min)
   Owner: CSM (with customer input)
   Outcome: Documented wins that justify the investment
   Format: 2-3 specific examples of value delivered:
   - "The [team] used [feature] to [outcome]. Result: [metric]."
   Facilitation Note: Ask the customer to share their perspective.
   Wins they articulate themselves are more powerful than wins
   you present.

4. CHALLENGES & OPEN ISSUES (10 min)
   Owner: Both sides
   Outcome: All issues surfaced with resolution plan
   Cover:
   - Open support tickets and their status
   - Feature requests and roadmap alignment
   - Adoption blockers and training needs
   - Any relationship or service concerns
   Facilitation Note: Do not hide from problems. Bringing them up
   proactively shows transparency. Have a resolution plan for
   each known issue.

5. PRODUCT ROADMAP PREVIEW (10 min)
   Owner: Account Manager
   Outcome: Customer excited about what's coming next
   Format: 2-3 upcoming features relevant to THEIR use case:
   - "In Q[next], we're launching [feature] which addresses
     your request for [capability]."
   Rule: Only show roadmap items relevant to them. Do not
   show the full product roadmap -- it overwhelms and sets
   expectations you may not meet.

6. STRATEGIC DISCUSSION & NEXT QUARTER GOALS (10 min)
   Owner: Both sides
   Outcome: Aligned goals for the next quarter, expansion discussion
   Questions:
   - "What are your team's top priorities for next quarter?"
   - "Are there other teams or use cases where this could help?"
   - "What would make this partnership even more valuable?"
   Facilitation Note: This is where expansion conversations
   naturally emerge. Listen for signals like "we wish more teams
   could use this" or "we need [capability] for [use case]."
```

---

## Negotiation / Commercial Discussion Agenda (45 minutes)

**Purpose:** Align on commercial terms, address concerns, and define the path to signature.
**Share Agenda:** Yes, 24 hours before. State clearly: "The goal of this meeting is to finalize terms."
**Key Rule:** Never negotiate without a clear walk-away point defined before the meeting.

### Full Template

```
NEGOTIATION AGENDA
Meeting: Commercial Discussion -- [Company Name]
Date: [Date] | Time: 45 minutes
Attendees: [Customer: key decision-makers] + [Your team: closer + support]
Meeting Owner: [AE/Sales Lead]

1. ALIGNMENT ON WHAT'S AGREED (5 min)
   Owner: AE
   Outcome: Both sides confirm shared understanding of scope and value
   Script: "Before we dive into terms, I want to confirm we're
   aligned on the scope: [summary of what they're buying, why,
   and the value it delivers]. Is that accurate?"
   Facilitation Note: This prevents re-litigating value during
   price negotiation. Get verbal agreement on value BEFORE
   discussing price.

2. PROPOSAL WALKTHROUGH (10 min)
   Owner: AE
   Outcome: Every line item understood with value justification
   Format: Walk through each component:
   - "[Line item]: This covers [capability]. Based on your
     need for [pain], this delivers [value]."
   Rule: Justify, don't apologize. Present pricing as an
   investment with known returns, not a cost to be minimized.

3. COMMERCIAL DISCUSSION (15 min)
   Owner: Both sides
   Outcome: Key concerns surfaced and addressed
   Expected Topics:
   - Total cost and budget alignment
   - Payment terms and billing structure
   - Contract length and flexibility
   - Volume pricing or usage tiers
   - SLAs and support levels
   Facilitation Note: When they push back, use ACE:
   Acknowledge -> Clarify -> Explore. Never make a concession
   without getting something in return.

4. PROCUREMENT & LEGAL PROCESS (10 min)
   Owner: Prospect procurement / AE
   Outcome: Clear understanding of internal approval steps
   Questions:
   - "What's the internal approval process from here?"
   - "Who needs to sign off on the contract?"
   - "Is there a security or legal review required?"
   - "What documentation do you need from us?"
   Facilitation Note: Map every step between "verbal yes" and
   "signed contract." Each step is a potential delay.

5. PATH TO CLOSE (5 min)
   Owner: AE
   Outcome: Specific next actions with dates and owners
   Script: "Great. Based on our discussion, here's what I propose:
   [Action 1] by [date], then [Action 2] by [date], with the
   goal of signing by [date]. Does that timeline work?"
   Rule: Get commitment to specific dates. "Soon" and "next
   week" are not dates.
```

## Executive Briefing Agenda (30 minutes)

   with the champion before the meeting.

2. BUSINESS CASE PRESENTATION (8 min)
   Owner: You

   buy business outcomes.

   Outcome: Understand executive's priorities and concerns
   Questions:
   - "How does this align with your priorities for this year?"
   - "What would make this a no-brainer decision?"
   - "What concerns would you want addressed?"
   Facilitation Note: This is the most important section. Let
   the executive talk. Their words reveal budget willingness,
   political dynamics, and true priorities.

4. THE ASK (4 min)
   Owner: You
   Outcome: Specific commitment from the executive
   Options (pick ONE):
   - Budget: "We'd need a decision on [budget] by [date]."
   - Sponsorship: "Can you authorize [champion] to lead this?"

## Agenda Adaptation Rules

### When the Meeting Runs Short on Time

| Time Remaining | Cut | Keep |
|---------------|-----|------|
| 10 min left | Middle discussion topics | Opening alignment + closing next steps |
| 5 min left | Everything except close | Next steps and commitments |
| Meeting cut in half | Core discussion to 1 topic | Opening, 1 key topic, close |

### When New Attendees Join Unexpectedly

1. Pause for a 30-second round of introductions
2. Adjust agenda to allocate time for their likely concerns
3. Do not skip the close -- even if you run out of discussion time

### When the Prospect Wants to Deviate

- If the detour is productive (reveals new information): Follow it, then redirect
- If the detour is tangential: "Great point -- can we bookmark that for a follow-up?"
- If the detour is derailing: "I want to make sure we cover [critical topic] before our time runs out"
