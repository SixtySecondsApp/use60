## First Touch Frameworks

### Mouse Trap
**When:** First cold outreach. You have one observation about the prospect.
**Structure:** Observation → Binary question (implies your solution)

**Example:**
```
Wayne, looks like you're growing your sales team.

Would it help to see how your reps' outreach is actually landing with prospects?
```

**Why it works:** The observation proves research. The question creates curiosity without pitching. The implied answer is "yes" which opens the door.

---

### Mouse Trap + Context
**When:** First touch when you need to briefly explain what you do.
**Structure:** Observation → Question → One-line context

**Example:**
```
Wayne, looks like you're growing your sales team.

Would it help to see how your reps' outreach is landing?

We built a tool that coaches reps on email in real-time — helps teams ramp faster.
```

---

### PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solve)
**When:** Prospect has a known pain point you can address.
**Structure:** State the problem → Make the pain vivid → Present your solution briefly

**Example:**
```
Wayne — managing cash across 15 locations means your team is counting bills, driving to the bank, and sitting in line.

You're burning money just to deposit money.

We built a smart safe that eliminates all of it. Your team gets 6 hours back per week.

Worth a look?
```

---

### BAB (Before → After → Bridge)
**When:** You can paint a clear contrast between current state and ideal state.
**Structure:** Describe current pain → Paint the better future → Your solution is the bridge

**Example:**
```
Right now your SDRs are sending 50 emails a day and hearing crickets.

Imagine if half of those got replies — and they were positive ones.

That's what happened when Sendoso's team started using our email coaching tool. Their reply rates doubled in 6 weeks.

Want to see how?
```

---

### 3Ps (Praise → Picture → Push)
**When:** Prospect has a recent achievement you can reference.
**Structure:** Genuine compliment → Connect to bigger opportunity → Soft push

**Example:**
```
Wayne — congrats on the Series B. Scaling from 20 to 50 reps is no joke.

If those new reps could ramp in half the time, that round starts paying back faster.

We're helping 3 other post-Series B teams do exactly that.

Interested in what they changed?
```

---

### Goated One-Liner
**When:** C-suite prospect. Ultra-brevity wins.
**Structure:** One powerful sentence → One line of proof → Two-word CTA

**Example:**
```
Your SDRs are sending emails at a 10th grade reading level — that's killing 67% of potential replies.

We fixed this for Drift's team in 2 weeks.

Worth exploring?
```

---

### Founder Card
**When:** Founder-to-founder outreach. Seeking feedback or partnership.
**Structure:** Problem you're solving → You're seeking feedback → What you do + credibility → Question

**Example:**
```
Wayne — is anything frustrating you about your team's email analytics?

I ask because I'm looking for feedback. I run Lavender. It's a real-time email coach that sits in your reps' inbox.

We're working with a few sales teams your size and I'm curious if the problems are similar.

Would you be open to a quick chat?
```

---

### Observation + Insight
**When:** You've noticed something specific about their business that connects to what you do.
**Structure:** Specific observation → Insight they might not have considered → Soft ask

**Example:**
```
Wayne — noticed your job posting for Senior Engineer has been up for 47 days.

At your likely cost-per-vacancy, that's roughly $30K in lost productivity.

3 companies your size cut that timeline in half last quarter. Happy to share what they changed.

Interested?
```

---

### Timeline Hook
**When:** You can connect your outreach to a time-sensitive event or deadline.
**Best performing hook type: 10.01% reply rate, 2.34x meetings vs problem hooks.**

**Example:**
```
Wayne — Q2 planning starts in 3 weeks.

If pipeline generation is on the agenda, one thing we're seeing work: teams that coach reps on email quality (not just volume) are booking 40% more meetings.

Worth a 10-minute look before you lock in the plan?
```

---

## Follow-Up Frameworks

### Thoughtful Bump (Day 3)
**When:** No reply to Email 1. Reference original context without repeating yourself.

**Example:**
```
Wayne — given your team is scaling, I thought coaching might be worth discussing.

Any feedback on my note?
```

---

### Clarification (Day 3-7)
**When:** You want to reframe your value prop from a different angle.

**Example:**
```
Wayne — to clarify what I meant:

We're not another email tool. We sit inside your reps' inbox and coach them on every email before they hit send.

Think Grammarly, but for sales emails.

Does that change anything?
```

---

### Neutral Insight / Value-Add (Day 7-10)
**When:** Share something useful unrelated to your pitch.

**Example:**
```
Wayne — saw this article on how Segment's VP of Sales Dev scaled to $3.2B acquisition.

Given you're ramping reps, thought you'd find it relevant.

[link]

Happy to riff on any of it.
```

---

### The Breakup (Day 14-17)
**When:** Final email. Graceful exit that often triggers a reply.

**Example:**
```
Wayne — I've reached out a couple times because your team is hiring fast and I thought our coaching tool could help reps ramp quicker.

Going to assume my timing is off.

Do you think this will be a priority next quarter? Happy to circle back then.
```

**Why breakups work:** Loss aversion. The prospect realizes the conversation is ending. If there was even mild interest, they'll often reply now rather than lose the option.

---

### The Referral (Day 10+)
**When:** You suspect you're emailing the wrong person.

**Example:**
```
Wayne — would Sarah be a better person to talk to about rep onboarding?

I reached out about our email coaching tool since you're scaling the sales team. If someone else owns that, happy to connect with them instead.
```

---

## Re-Engagement Frameworks

### Priority Check (simplest)
One sentence: "Is [specific problem] still a priority?"

### New Update
```
Wayne — last time we spoke, personalization was a big focus for your reps.

Not sure if that's still the case, but we shipped a major update to our personalization engine. It's 10x faster now.

Worth a second look?
```

### Their Update
```
Wayne — saw you're now hiring SDRs. Last time we talked, you were having AEs do their own prospecting.

Does that mean it wasn't working? Our dashboards could help you figure out where it broke down.

Open to a quick look?
```

---

## Specialized Frameworks

### Event Invitation
**Combine Timeline hook + Social Proof + Low-friction CTA.**

**Example:**
```
Wayne — you sell to fleet managers. Quick question:

When you reach out, do they actually engage with your content? Or just ignore it?

We ran a breakfast in Bristol last month where 12 sales pros shared what's actually working. One guy doubled his reply rate in 3 weeks.

Running another March 6th. Small group, no pitches, just tactics.

Worth a seat?
```

### Customer Mirror (Storytelling)
**When:** You want to tell a relatable customer story without name-dropping.

**Example:**
```
Your team is growing fast, Wayne. Curious if this sounds familiar:

Company raises a round. Hires 15 new reps. Everyone knows personalization matters but nobody can figure out how to do it at scale.

That's exactly where one of our customers was 6 months ago. Now their reps write personalized emails in half the time.

Similar situation?
```

### Competitor Aware
**When:** You know they use a competitor product.

**Example:**
```
Wayne — saw you're using Outreach for sequencing.

How's it working for coaching reps on email quality? That's where most teams tell us it falls short.

Curious if you're seeing the same thing.
```
