## Template Selection Guide

| Deal Characteristic | Template | Typical Milestones | Typical Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| New logo, under $50K, 1-2 decision makers | SMB | 4-5 | 2-6 weeks |
| New logo, $50K-$250K, 2-4 decision makers | Mid-Market | 5-6 | 4-12 weeks |
| New logo, $250K+, 4-8+ decision makers | Enterprise | 6-7 | 3-9 months |
| Existing customer, new product or expansion | Expansion | 4-5 | 2-8 weeks |
| Contract renewal with upsell component | Renewal + Upsell | 3-4 | 2-4 weeks |

**Selection rule**: When in doubt, use the more complex template. It is easier to remove milestones than to discover late that you missed a critical step.

## SMB MAP Template (Under $50K)

**Characteristics**: Short cycle, few stakeholders, minimal procurement, fast decisions. The buyer is often the economic buyer, technical evaluator, and end user rolled into one.

**Risk**: SMB deals die from inertia, not process. The MAP must maintain momentum with short milestone gaps.

### Template Structure

```

**SMB Timing Rules**:
- Total MAP duration: 2-4 weeks (aggressive), 4-6 weeks (conservative)
- Milestone spacing: 3-5 business days maximum
- If any milestone takes longer than 5 business days, the deal is stalling -- diagnose immediately
- Legal review: often unnecessary or same-day for SMB

---

## Mid-Market MAP Template ($50K-$250K)

**Characteristics**: Multiple stakeholders, some procurement process, evaluation period with comparison to alternatives. The champion is usually not the final decision maker.

**Risk**: Mid-market deals die from missing stakeholders. The champion loves you, but their boss has never heard of you. The MAP must force multi-threaded engagement early.

### Template Structure

---

## Enterprise MAP Template ($250K+)

**Characteristics**: Complex buying committee (4-8+ stakeholders), formal procurement, legal review of MSA/DPA/SLA, potential board approval, long evaluation with competing priorities.

**Risk**: Enterprise deals die from complexity and organizational change. The MAP must track parallel workstreams and anticipate bureaucratic delays.

---

## Owner Assignment Guide

Ownership distribution is a diagnostic tool. Use this guide to assign owners and then check the distribution for deal health signals.

### Ownership Rules

| Milestone Type | Default Owner | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery / stakeholder mapping | Shared | Both parties must invest in understanding |
| Demo / solution presentation | Us | We control the experience |
| Technical validation | Shared | Buyer provides environment, we prove it works |
| Business case / ROI | Us (build) / Customer (present internally) | We build the case, they sell it internally |
| Reference calls | Us (arrange) / Customer (attend) | We connect, they validate |
| Proposal delivery | Us | We control the document |
| Proposal review / negotiation | Shared | Both sides must engage |
| Legal / security review | Customer (drive) / Us (respond) | Their process, our compliance |
| Procurement / vendor registration | Customer | Their internal process |
| Executive approval | Customer | Their internal decision |
| Contract signature | Shared | Both parties execute |

### Health Check by Ownership Distribution

| Owner | Healthy Range | Warning | Red Flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Customer-owned | 30-50% | Below 25% (buyer is passive) | 0% (no buyer commitment) |
| Seller-owned | 25-40% | Above 60% (doing all the work) | Above 80% (buyer disengaged) |
| Shared | 20-35% | Below 10% (no collaboration) | 0% (no joint milestones) |

---

## Timeline Calculation Framework

### Step 1: Determine Base Duration

Start with the deal type base duration:

| Deal Type | Aggressive | Conservative | Use Conservative When |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMB | 2 weeks | 6 weeks | First-time vendor, no urgency, multiple evaluators |
| Mid-Market | 6 weeks | 12 weeks | Formal procurement, 3+ stakeholders, legal review required |
| Enterprise | 3 months | 9 months | Board approval needed, global deployment, regulatory requirements |

### Step 2: Add Process Buffers

| Process Step | Minimum Buffer | Enterprise Buffer |
|---|---|---|
| Legal review (MSA) | 1 week | 4 weeks |
| Security review | 1 week | 3 weeks |
| Procurement / vendor registration | 1 week | 4 weeks |
| Executive approval (per layer) | 3 days | 2 weeks |
| Board approval | N/A | 4-8 weeks (align to board cycle) |
| DPA negotiation | 3 days | 2 weeks |

### Step 3: Apply the 20% Buffer Rule

After calculating total milestone duration, add 20% buffer spread across all milestones. This accounts for:
- Vacation and out-of-office delays
- Competing priorities on the buyer's side
- Internal approval delays
- Unforeseen technical questions

### Step 4: Validate Against Close Date

If the calculated timeline exceeds the target close date:
1. Do NOT compress milestones to fit
2. Flag the discrepancy in the MAP risks section
3. Identify which milestones could realistically be accelerated
4. Propose the honest timeline and let the rep negotiate with the buyer

```

**Why this MAP works:**
- North Star is the buyer's outcome, not ours ("reduce churn analysis from 3 days to real-time")
- Risks are specific to THIS deal (competitor demo date, fiscal year deadline, missing VP)
- First milestone addresses the biggest structural risk (VP not engaged)
- 40% of milestones are customer-owned (healthy engagement balance)
- Timeline has built-in buffer (13 business days of slack across 6 milestones)
- Exit criteria are all verifiable without asking for opinions
