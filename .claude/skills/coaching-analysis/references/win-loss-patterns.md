# Win/Loss Patterns: Behavioral Correlations with Deal Outcomes

This reference contains behavioral patterns correlated with deal outcomes, drawn from conversation intelligence research (Gong, Chorus, Clari, Revenue.io), sales methodology studies (RAIN Group, Challenger, MEDDIC), and academic research. These patterns power the "Compare to Winning Patterns" step of the coaching-analysis skill.

When coaching, compare the rep's behaviors to these patterns. Org-specific data always takes precedence over industry benchmarks when available (10+ closed deals with meeting data).

## 1. Discovery Behaviors in Won vs Lost Deals

Discovery is the single highest-leverage phase of any sales cycle. The depth and quality of discovery directly predicts deal outcomes.

### Statistical Data

| Behavior | Won Deals | Lost Deals | Delta | Source |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Questions asked per discovery call | 12.4 avg | 7.1 avg | +75% | Gong (2023), 125K deals |
| Problem questions asked | 4.2 avg | 1.8 avg | +133% | Gong (2023) |
| Implication questions asked | 2.8 avg | 0.6 avg | +367% | Gong (2023) |
| Pain quantified (dollar/time) | 68% of calls | 23% of calls | +196% | Chorus (2022) |
| Prospect talk time in discovery | 57% avg | 38% avg | +50% | Gong (2023) |
| Discovery call duration | 38 min avg | 26 min avg | +46% | Revenue.io (2023) |

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1: Depth Over Breadth**
Won deals have deeper exploration of fewer topics rather than shallow coverage of many topics. Winners spend an average of 6.2 minutes per pain point vs 2.1 minutes for losers (Gong, 2023). Coaching implication: "Stay on the thread. When you find pain, pull the thread until you hit root cause."

**Pattern 2: Quantification Changes Everything**
When a prospect puts a number on their problem ("This is costing us $200K per quarter in lost deals"), the deal is 2.7x more likely to close (Chorus, 2022). The act of quantifying pain creates psychological commitment to solving it. Most reps accept qualitative descriptions ("it's a big problem") without pushing for numbers.

**Pattern 3: The Second Why**
Top performers ask "why" at least twice when exploring a problem (the "Five Whys" technique, adapted). The first answer is usually a symptom. The second reveals the real issue. Won deals had an average of 2.3 "layers" of problem exploration vs 1.1 for lost deals (Gong, internal analysis).

**Pattern 4: Discovery Does Not End After Call One**
In complex sales (deal value > $25K), deals where discovery continued into call 2 and beyond (new stakeholders, new dimensions of the problem) had 41% higher win rates than deals where discovery was treated as a one-and-done phase (Clari, 2023).

## 2. Objection Handling Patterns

How reps respond to objections is one of the most measurable predictors of deal outcomes.

### Response Pattern Analysis

| Response Pattern | Win Rate | Description | Source |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Acknowledge + Explore + Reframe + Evidence | 62% | Full handling: empathy, curiosity, context, proof | Gong (2023) |
| Acknowledge + Explore + Reframe | 51% | Good handling but lacks concrete proof | Gong (2023) |
| Acknowledge + Direct Response | 38% | Adequate but transactional | Gong (2023) |
| Deflect / Redirect | 24% | "Let me show you this feature instead" | Gong (2023) |
| Ignore | 18% | Pretend objection was not raised | Gong (2023) |
| Argue / Push Back | 14% | "Actually, that's not right because..." | Chorus (2022) |

### Objection Type Win Rates

Not all objections are equal. Some are buying signals in disguise.

| Objection Type | Presence in Won Deals | Presence in Lost Deals | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Price / Budget | 64% | 71% | Common in both -- handling matters more than presence |
| Timeline / Urgency | 42% | 58% | More common in losses -- often masks deeper issue |
| Authority / Process | 38% | 29% | Actually more common in wins -- signals deal is progressing to procurement |
| Competition | 48% | 52% | Slightly more common in losses, but competitive deals that are won tend to be stickier |
| Status Quo | 22% | 47% | Strong loss indicator -- means you have not created enough urgency |
| Risk / Change | 35% | 44% | Moderate loss indicator -- means you have not de-risked the decision |

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1: Objections Are Invitations**
Deals with zero objections actually have a lower win rate (29%) than deals with 1-3 objections handled well (52%) (Gong, 2023). No objections usually means the prospect is not engaged enough to push back. Coaching implication: "Objections mean they're thinking about actually buying. Welcome them."

**Pattern 2: The Explore Step Is Most Often Skipped**
In the Acknowledge-Explore-Reframe-Evidence framework, the "Explore" step (asking questions about the objection) is skipped 73% of the time by average reps (Chorus, 2022). They jump from "I hear you" to "Let me address that." Top performers spend 45-90 seconds exploring the objection before responding. "Help me understand what specifically concerns you about the timeline" is more effective than "We can definitely hit that deadline."

**Pattern 3: Price Objections Are Rarely About Price**
Gong's analysis of 15,000 price objections found that only 31% were genuine budget constraints. The remaining 69% were value objections disguised as price objections -- the prospect did not see enough value to justify the investment. When reps explored price objections with "Help me understand -- is the price outside your budget, or are you wondering if the outcome is worth the investment?", they uncovered the real objection 64% of the time.

**Pattern 4: The "Feel, Felt, Found" Framework Still Works**
Despite being decades old, the Feel-Felt-Found pattern remains effective when delivered authentically (not robotically). "I understand how you feel. Other [similar companies] felt the same way. What they found was [specific outcome]." Gong data shows this pattern, when followed by a specific case study, converts 47% of objections to positive progression.

## 3. Follow-Up Speed Correlation

The speed of post-meeting follow-up is a surprisingly powerful predictor of deal outcomes.

### Statistical Data

| Follow-Up Timing | Advancement Rate | Source |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Within 1 hour | 68% | Revenue.io (2023), 50K deals |
| Within 4 hours | 57% | Revenue.io (2023) |
| Same business day | 48% | Revenue.io (2023) |
| Next business day | 36% | Revenue.io (2023) |
| 2+ business days | 21% | Revenue.io (2023) |
| 5+ business days | 9% | Revenue.io (2023) |

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1: The 1-Hour Window**
Following up within 1 hour of a meeting (with a summary, next steps, or requested materials) results in 68% deal advancement vs 36% for next-day follow-up (Revenue.io). This is a 1.9x multiplier from a simple behavioral change. The psychology: the prospect is still thinking about the conversation, and immediate follow-up signals competence and urgency.

**Pattern 2: Quality + Speed Compound**
A fast, high-quality follow-up (summarizing pain points in the prospect's words, confirming next steps, providing one relevant resource) is 3.2x more effective than a fast, generic follow-up ("Great chatting, let me know if you have questions") (Gong, 2023).

**Pattern 3: The "Recap Email" Pattern**
Won deals had a follow-up email that included: (1) summary of the prospect's stated problems, (2) agreed-upon next steps with dates, (3) one relevant resource or case study, in 78% of cases (Clari, 2023). Lost deals had this pattern in only 23% of cases.

## 4. Meeting Cadence in Winning Deals

The rhythm and pacing of meetings throughout the deal cycle reveals engagement and momentum.

### Statistical Data

| Metric | Won Deals | Lost Deals | Source |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Avg days between meetings | 4.2 days | 8.7 days | Gong (2023) |
| Total meetings to close | 3.8 avg | 2.1 avg (before stalling) | Clari (2023) |
| Calendar gaps > 14 days | 12% of won | 54% of lost | Gong (2023) |
| Meetings per month | 3.4 avg | 1.6 avg | Ebsta (2023) |

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1: Momentum Kills Deals When Lost**
The single biggest predictor of a deal dying is a gap of more than 14 days between touchpoints. 54% of lost deals had a gap of 14+ days at some point in the cycle (Gong, 2023). Coaching implication: "Never leave a meeting without the next meeting booked. If you can't get a meeting, at least get a committed follow-up date."

**Pattern 2: More Meetings (Up to a Point)**
Won deals average 3.8 meetings vs 2.1 for lost deals (Clari, 2023). Lost deals often stall after 1-2 meetings, not because the prospect said no, but because the next meeting never got scheduled. However, deals with 7+ meetings show diminishing returns -- this often indicates a stuck deal cycling through demos without progressing.

**Pattern 3: Cadence Accelerates Toward Close**
In winning deals, the gap between meetings shortens as the deal progresses. First gap: 7 days average. Second gap: 5 days. Third gap: 3 days. Deals where gaps increase over time (7 -> 10 -> 14) are 3.4x more likely to be lost (Gong, internal analysis).

**Pattern 4: Multi-Stakeholder Meeting Timing**
The optimal time to introduce additional stakeholders is meeting 2 or 3 -- after initial champion alignment but before proposal. Deals where new stakeholders are introduced only at the proposal stage (too late for discovery) have 42% lower win rates (Ebsta, 2023).

## 5. Champion Development Indicators

A champion is an internal advocate who sells on your behalf when you are not in the room. Identifying and developing champions is critical for complex sales.

### Champion Identification Signals

| Signal | Strength | What It Looks Like |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Uses "we" when talking about your solution | Strong | "We could use this for..." vs "You could sell this to..." |
| Shares internal information unprompted | Strong | Reveals org politics, competing priorities, budget cycles |
| Suggests next steps proactively | Strong | "You should talk to Sarah in Engineering" |
| Asks about implementation details | Moderate | "How would we actually roll this out?" |
| Coaches you on internal selling | Very Strong | "When you talk to the CFO, emphasize..." |
| Forwards your emails internally | Strong | Visible in CC chains or referenced in later meetings |
| Asks about competitive positioning | Moderate | Wants ammunition to defend the choice internally |
| Introduces you to other stakeholders | Very Strong | Makes proactive introductions without being asked |

### Champion vs Friendly Contact

| Champion Behavior | Friendly Contact Behavior |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Takes action on your behalf | Enjoys the meetings but does not act |
| Shares political context | Gives surface-level positive feedback |
| Commits calendar time for next steps | "Let me check my schedule and get back to you" |
| Uses "we" (includes your solution in their plans) | Uses "you" (keeps your solution at arm's length) |
| Tells you bad news honestly | Avoids uncomfortable conversations |
| Asks hard questions about your product | Only asks easy questions |

### Statistical Impact

| Champion Status | Win Rate | Source |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| Identified champion + coach | 63% | Ebsta (2023), 30K enterprise deals |
| Identified champion, not coached | 41% | Ebsta (2023) |
| No identified champion | 17% | Ebsta (2023) |
| Multiple champions (2+) | 74% | Clari (2023) |

### Coaching Implications

- **Look for champion signals in every meeting**: Track which contacts display champion behaviors vs friendly contact behaviors.
- **Champion coaching in meeting 2-3**: After identifying a potential champion, coach them explicitly. "When you bring this to [decision maker], what do you think their main concern will be? How can I help you address that?"
- **Champion health check**: If a previously active champion goes quiet (fewer emails, shorter meeting participation, less internal advocacy), the deal is at risk.

## 6. Multi-Stakeholder Engagement Patterns

Complex deals are won or lost based on breadth of engagement across the buying organization.

### Statistical Data

| Contacts Engaged | Win Rate | Average Deal Velocity | Source |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 contact | 14% | Slowest (single dependency) | Gong (2023) |
| 2 contacts | 28% | Moderate | Gong (2023) |
| 3 contacts | 51% | 30% faster | Gong (2023) |
| 4+ contacts | 62% | 45% faster | Ebsta (2023) |
| 5+ contacts | 71% | 55% faster (diminishing returns after 6) | Ebsta (2023) |

### Stakeholder Role Coverage

| Role | Present in Won Deals | Present in Lost Deals | Gap |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|-----|
| Economic Buyer (signs the check) | 87% | 42% | 45% gap |
| Champion (internal advocate) | 91% | 34% | 57% gap |
| Technical Evaluator | 72% | 51% | 21% gap |
| End User / Day-to-Day | 64% | 38% | 26% gap |
| Procurement / Legal | 58% | 22% | 36% gap (late stage) |

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1: The Power of Three**
Going from 1 to 3 contacts triples the win rate (14% to 51%) and accelerates deals by 30% (Gong, 2023). This is one of the highest-ROI behavioral changes available. Coaching implication: "Who else on the prospect's side should be in our next meeting?"

**Pattern 2: Economic Buyer Access Is the #1 Differentiator**
The largest gap between won and lost deals is Economic Buyer engagement (87% vs 42%). Reps who meet the economic buyer win at 2x the rate of those who don't. Many reps are afraid to ask for access because it might "go over their contact's head." Top performers frame it as collaborative: "For a decision this important, I'd love to understand [EB name]'s priorities directly. Would it help if we set up a brief conversation?"

**Pattern 3: Timing of Multi-Threading**
Won deals introduced the second stakeholder by meeting 2 in 78% of cases (Ebsta, 2023). Lost deals that eventually engaged multiple stakeholders typically did so after meeting 4 (too late -- positions are already hardened). Coaching implication: "Ask about other stakeholders in the first meeting. Get the second meeting with a new person."

**Pattern 4: Stakeholder Sentiment Tracking**
In won deals, reps tracked sentiment by stakeholder (who is supportive, neutral, resistant) in 67% of cases vs 19% for lost deals (Clari, 2023). This mapping enables targeted messaging and objection handling per stakeholder.

## 7. Proposal Timing Relative to Discovery Depth

When a proposal is sent relative to how much discovery has been done significantly impacts outcomes.

### Statistical Data

| Discovery Depth Before Proposal | Win Rate | Source |
|--------------------------------|----------|--------|
| Full discovery (3+ meetings, pain quantified, stakeholders mapped) | 58% | Gong (2023) |
| Moderate discovery (2 meetings, pain identified but not quantified) | 34% | Gong (2023) |
| Light discovery (1 meeting, surface-level understanding) | 18% | Gong (2023) |
| No discovery (proposal sent from RFP/inbound request alone) | 11% | Gong (2023) |

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1: The Discovery-Proposal Gap**
Deals where the proposal was sent within 48 hours of the first meeting had an 18% win rate. Deals where at least 2 discovery meetings preceded the proposal had a 48% win rate (Gong, 2023). Rushed proposals signal desperation and result in misaligned solutions.

**Pattern 2: Proposal Personalization Correlates with Discovery**
Proposals that referenced specific prospect quotes and pain points (only possible with deep discovery) had a 3.1x higher close rate than template proposals (Proposify, 2.6M proposals analyzed). The proposal is downstream of discovery -- better discovery enables better proposals.

**Pattern 3: The "Mutual Action Plan" Before Proposal**
Deals where the rep established a mutual action plan (agreed milestones, responsibilities, and timeline) before sending the proposal had a 42% win rate vs 27% without (Clari, 2023). The MAP itself is a commitment device.

## 8. Price Presentation Techniques and Outcomes

How price is presented -- the words, the framing, the timing within the conversation -- materially impacts close rates.

### Presentation Technique Analysis

| Technique | Win Rate Lift | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Anchoring high | +18% | Present highest option first | Gong (2023) |
| Value before price | +23% | State the outcome, then the investment | Gong (2023) |
| Price per unit/day | +12% | Break down to smallest increment | Revenue.io (2023) |
| Confident delivery (no hedging) | +26% | "The investment is $X" not "So... it would be about... $X" | Gong (2023) |
| Silence after price | +14% | Pause 3+ seconds after stating price | Chorus (2022) |
| Three options | +21% | Decoy effect: 3 tiers with anchor | Multiple sources |

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1: The Confidence Effect**
Gong analyzed the vocal patterns of 67,000 pricing conversations. Reps who stated the price confidently (steady tone, no hedging words, no upward inflection) had a 26% higher close rate. Hedging signals ("it's kind of around...", "the price is, um...") trigger prospect anxiety. Coaching implication: "Practice saying the price out loud until it feels natural."

**Pattern 2: The Post-Price Pause**
After stating the price, top performers pause for 3-5 seconds. Average reps immediately start justifying or discounting. The silence gives the prospect time to process and respond. 78% of prospects who receive silence after pricing respond with either acceptance or a specific concern (which can be handled). Reps who immediately justify hear "let me think about it" 2.3x more often (Chorus, 2022).

**Pattern 3: Discounting Destroys Value**
Deals where the rep offered a discount unprompted had a 17% lower win rate than deals where the rep held price (Gong, 2023). When discounts were offered, the average discount was 22%. Deals where the prospect requested a discount and the rep held firm (or offered non-monetary value) actually had a 12% higher win rate than deals closed at full price without negotiation.

**Pattern 4: Investment Framing**
Using the word "investment" instead of "cost" or "price" correlates with a 9% higher close rate (Gong, 2023). Framing: "The investment for the Growth tier is $X per year, which based on the $Y you mentioned you're losing to [problem], would pay for itself in [Z months]."

---

## 9. Competitive Displacement Patterns

Winning deals where the prospect is already using a competitor requires specific behaviors.

### Statistical Data

| Displacement Behavior | Win Rate | Source |
|----------------------|----------|--------|
| Focused on "switching cost" reduction | 47% | Gong (2023), 8K displacement deals |
| Focused on product superiority | 31% | Gong (2023) |
| Focused on competitor weakness | 24% | Gong (2023) |
| Asked "what would need to be true" | 52% | Chorus (2022) |

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1: The "What Would Need to Be True" Question**
In competitive displacement deals, the single most effective question is: "What would need to be true for you to consider making a change?" This question had a 52% win rate correlation (Chorus, 2022) because it surfaces the prospect's own switching criteria rather than the rep guessing.

**Pattern 2: Switching Cost Reduction Wins**
Rather than arguing product superiority (which creates resistance), top performers focus on reducing the perceived cost of switching: implementation support, data migration, parallel running, training, and guaranteed outcomes. This approach wins 47% vs 31% for product-superiority arguments (Gong, 2023).

**Pattern 3: Validate the Current Choice**
"You made a great choice when you chose [competitor] -- they're a strong product for [specific use case]. What's changed in your business since then?" This approach validates the prospect's past decision (reducing cognitive dissonance) while opening the door to current gaps. Win rate: 44% vs 28% for reps who start with "what's wrong with [competitor]?" (Gong, 2023).

**Pattern 4: The 10x Rule**
Buyers typically need to perceive a 10x improvement to justify switching costs (academic research, Kahneman's loss aversion). Reps who quantified a 10x+ improvement in at least one dimension won competitive deals at 2.1x the rate of those who argued general superiority (Gong, internal analysis).

## 10. The First Five Minutes Hypothesis

Research consistently shows that the opening minutes of a sales conversation set the trajectory for the entire call and the deal.

### Statistical Data

| First 5 Minutes Behavior | Impact on Win Rate | Source |
|--------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Established problem context | +22% | Gong (2023), 200K calls |
| Set collaborative agenda | +28% | Revenue.io (2023) |
| Led with company overview | -18% | Gong (2023) |
| Led with product features | -24% | Gong (2023) |
| Referenced prospect-specific research | +31% | Chorus (2022) |
| Asked "how have you been" (cold call) | +6.6x success rate | Gong (2023) |

### Key Patterns

**Pattern 1: Problem-First Opening**
Top performers reference the prospect's problem within the first 5 minutes, before any discussion of product or company. This can be from prior research, previous conversations, or the prospect's initial outreach. "I saw your team is [specific observation] -- is [specific challenge] something you're running into?" Deals opened this way have a 22% higher win rate (Gong, 2023).

**Pattern 2: The Collaborative Agenda**
"Here's what I was thinking we'd cover -- and I'd love to hear if there's anything else you want to make sure we discuss." This opener establishes structure, signals respect for the prospect's time, and creates permission for both parties to drive the conversation. 28% higher conversion (Revenue.io, 2023).

**Pattern 3: The Anti-Pattern -- The "About Us" Open**
Starting with a company overview ("Let me tell you a bit about us...") reduces win rates by 18% (Gong, 2023). The prospect did not join the call to hear a corporate presentation. They came because they have a problem. Leading with credentials signals insecurity and wastes the most engaged minutes of the call.

**Pattern 4: Research Signaling**
Referencing one specific, relevant piece of research about the prospect ("I noticed you recently [specific event/announcement/hire]") in the first 5 minutes correlates with a 31% higher win rate (Chorus, 2022). It signals preparation, relevance, and respect. Generic openers ("Tell me about your business") signal laziness.

**Pattern 5: The Energy Match**
Top performers match the prospect's energy level within the first 2 minutes and then gradually elevate it (Gong, vocal analysis). Starting at a much higher energy than the prospect creates dissonance. Starting at a much lower energy signals disinterest. Match first, then lead.

## Composite Win/Loss Behavioral Model

When analyzing a deal or coaching from a meeting, score these dimensions and compare to the winning baseline:

| Dimension | Won Deals Average | Lost Deals Average | Weight |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Discovery Depth (1-5) | 4.1 | 2.3 | 25% |
| Objection Handling (1-5) | 3.8 | 2.1 | 15% |
| Multi-Stakeholder Engagement | 3.4 contacts | 1.6 contacts | 20% |
| Follow-Up Speed | 2.1 hours avg | 18.4 hours avg | 10% |
| Meeting Cadence (days between) | 4.2 days | 8.7 days | 10% |
| Champion Identified | 91% yes | 34% yes | 10% |
| Next Steps Specificity (1-5) | 4.3 | 2.2 | 10% |

### Using This Model for Coaching

1. **Per-meeting coaching**: Score the rep on the dimensions observable in a single meeting (discovery, questions, objections, next steps).
2. **Deal-level coaching**: Score across the full deal lifecycle (meeting cadence, multi-threading, champion development, follow-up speed).
3. **Trend coaching**: Compare the rep's scores over time to identify improving, plateauing, and declining behaviors.
4. **Org benchmarking**: Compare the rep's scores to the org's winning averages. This is more motivating than abstract benchmarks because it shows what "good" looks like in their specific context.

### The One Thing Framework

When delivering coaching, identify the single highest-leverage behavioral change:
1. Find the dimension with the largest gap between the rep's score and the winning baseline.
2. Isolate one specific behavior within that dimension.
3. Give a concrete, actionable instruction with an example from the meeting.
4. Set a measurable target for the next 5 calls.

This is more effective than a list of 10 improvements. Research on behavioral change (BJ Fogg, Stanford) shows that one targeted behavior change at a time has a 79% adoption rate vs 12% for three or more simultaneous changes.
