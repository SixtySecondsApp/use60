## Why Battlecards Win Deals

The data is unambiguous:

- **Reps with battlecards win 23% more competitive deals** than those without (Crayon, 2024 State of Competitive Intelligence)
- **89% of companies that invest in CI win more competitive deals** (Crayon, 2023)
- **Reps who use CI content in deals close 35% faster** on average (Klue, 2024)
- **But only 30% of reps use battlecards when they exist**, usually because the cards are too long, too generic, or too hard to find mid-call (Gong, 2024)

The implication is clear: battlecards work, but only if they are scannable, honest, and immediately accessible. A 15-page PDF that lives in a SharePoint folder no one can find is not a battlecard. A card that can be pulled up in 10 seconds and scanned in 30 seconds is a weapon.

## Template 1: Quick Reference Card

**Purpose**: Mid-call reference. The rep is on a live call and the prospect just mentioned a competitor. They need key talking points in 30 seconds.

**Length**: 1 page / 1 screen. No scrolling required.

**When to use**: During live calls, in the hallway before a meeting, when a prospect drops a competitor name and you need to respond immediately.

## Template 3: Displacement Playbook

**Purpose**: Winning a switchout deal. The prospect is currently using the competitor, and you need to convince them to switch. This is the hardest type of competitive deal.

**Length**: 2-3 pages. Focused on the switching narrative, not just feature comparison.

**When to use**: When you have confirmed the prospect is a current customer of the competitor, and they are evaluating a switch.

### Section 1: Know the Battlefield

```
DISPLACEMENT OVERVIEW
=====================

Competitor:         [Name]
Prospect status:    Current customer since approximately [date/duration]
Contract status:    [ ] Annual renewal (next renewal: ______)
                    [ ] Monthly (can switch anytime)
                    [ ] Multi-year (locked until ______)
Estimated spend:    [What they're paying the competitor, if known]
Known pain points:  [Why they're evaluating alternatives]
Switching catalyst: [What triggered the evaluation]

SWITCHING COST ASSESSMENT:

Data migration:     [ ] Easy (export/import)  [ ] Medium (API migration)  [ ] Hard (manual)
Workflow disruption:[ ] Low (parallel run possible)  [ ] Medium  [ ] High (full cutover)
Training required:  [ ] Minimal (<1 day)  [ ] Moderate (1-3 days)  [ ] Significant (1+ week)
Integration impact: [ ] Low (few integrations)  [ ] Medium  [ ] High (deeply embedded)

Overall switching difficulty: [ ] Easy  [ ] Moderate  [ ] Hard
```

### Section 2: The Displacement Narrative

```
THE COST OF STAYING (quantify these for the prospect):

1. [Specific cost or inefficiency they are experiencing with the competitor]
   Estimated annual cost: $______
   Source: [How you know this -- prospect said it, reviews cite it, etc.]

2. [Another cost or missed opportunity]
   Estimated annual cost: $______
   Source: [How you know this]

3. [Growth limitation -- what they cannot do with the competitor]
   Impact: [Describe the ceiling]

Total estimated cost of staying: $______ / year
Your product cost: $______ / year
Net benefit of switching: $______ / year

THE SWITCHING PLAN:

Week 1-2: [Phase 1 -- what happens first]
  - Data migration support
  - Parallel running with both tools
  - Core team training

Week 3-4: [Phase 2 -- full transition]
  - Team-wide rollout
  - Integration cutover
  - Decommission old tool

Week 5+: [Phase 3 -- optimization]
  - Usage monitoring
  - Advanced feature adoption
  - Success check-in

MIGRATION SUPPORT WE OFFER:
- [Dedicated migration specialist]
- [Data import tools / white-glove migration service]
- [Parallel running period at no additional cost]
- [Training program included in onboarding]
```

### Section 3: The Champion Playbook

```
FINDING AND ARMING THE CHAMPION
================================

Ideal champion profile:
- [Title/role that would benefit most from switching]
- [What frustration they likely feel with the competitor]
- [Why they would advocate internally for the switch]

How to identify them:
- Ask: "Who on your team is most frustrated with [competitor's known weakness]?"
- Look for: The person who asks the most detailed questions during evaluation
- Check: LinkedIn for recent role changes (new leaders re-evaluate tools)

How to arm them:
1. Give them a one-page ROI summary they can share with their boss
2. Provide a "switching checklist" that makes the process feel manageable
3. Share a case study from a company that successfully switched
4. Offer a reference call with a customer who made the same switch

CHAMPION CONVERSATION STARTERS:
- "What would need to be true for you to recommend switching?"
- "If we could solve [pain point] and make migration painless, what else would matter?"
- "Who else needs to be convinced, and what do they care about most?"
```

## Elevator Pitch Structure

The elevator pitch is the 15-30 second positioning statement a rep delivers when a prospect asks "How are you different from [competitor]?"

### Structure

```
"[Competitor] is [honest acknowledgment of what they are/do well].
The key difference is [your primary differentiator -- one thing, not a list].
Teams like yours typically choose us because [buyer-centric outcome with proof]."
```

### Rules

1. **Acknowledge the competitor first.** This shows confidence and honesty. Dismissing them looks defensive.
2. **One differentiator, not five.** The prospect will remember one thing. Make it the most important one.
3. **Buyer-centric language.** "Teams like yours" not "Our product." "Choose us because" not "We are better because."
4. **End with proof.** A specific metric, a customer name, or a data point. Without proof, it is just a claim.

### Anti-Patterns

| Bad Pitch | Why It Fails |
|-----------|-------------|
| "We're better than them in every way." | No one believes this. Instant credibility loss. |
| "They're really struggling with quality issues." | Bashing. Buyer distrust increases 12% (Gong). |
| "We have features A, B, C, D, E, and F that they don't." | Feature dumping. Not memorable. Not buyer-centric. |
| "We're basically the same but cheaper." | Commoditizes your product. Invites a price war you will lose. |

---

## Feature Comparison Table Format

### Rating Definitions (Use Consistently)

| Rating | Symbol | Definition | Evidence Required |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Strong** | ++ | Well-built, positively reviewed, competitive advantage | G2 reviews, product page, analyst report |
| **Moderate** | + | Capability exists, adequate for most use cases, not best-in-class | Product page confirms feature exists, reviews are mixed |
| **Weak** | - | Rudimentary, unreliable, or consistently cited as a pain point | Negative reviews, customer complaints, known limitations |
| **Absent** | -- | Does not exist or is so limited it is functionally absent | Cannot find evidence of the feature anywhere |
| **Unknown** | ? | Cannot determine from available information | Note this honestly. Do not guess. |

### Honesty Rules for Feature Comparison

1. You must rate yourself as Weak or Absent in at least one category. If you cannot find one, you are not looking honestly.
2. You must rate the competitor as Strong in at least one category. If you cannot find one, you are building propaganda, not a battlecard.
3. Every rating must have a cited evidence source. "We think they're weak" is not evidence.
4. "Unknown" is always preferable to a guess.

## Win Theme Format

### Structure

Each win theme contains three elements:

```
THEME: [One sentence that captures the competitive advantage]

PROOF POINT: [Specific, verifiable evidence that supports the theme]

EVIDENCE: [Customer quote, data point, or case study reference that
           makes it credible to a skeptical buyer]
```

### Win Theme Quality Checklist

- [ ] Is the theme about a STRUCTURAL advantage (hard for competitor to fix)?
- [ ] Is the proof point specific and verifiable?
- [ ] Is the evidence from a credible source (customer, analyst, data)?
- [ ] Does the theme matter to the buyer (not just to you)?
- [ ] Can the rep state the theme in one sentence from memory?

### What Makes a Good vs. Bad Win Theme

| Good Win Theme | Bad Win Theme | Why |
|---------------|--------------|-----|
| "Purpose-built for mid-market, not enterprise-scaled-down" | "We have more features" | Structural advantage vs. temporary gap |
| "2-week implementation vs. their 3-month deployment" | "We're easier to use" | Specific and measurable vs. vague claim |
| "AI copilot that executes, not just recommends" | "Better AI" | Differentiated approach vs. undifferentiated claim |

## Landmine Question Format

### Structure

```
QUESTION: "[The question to ask during discovery]"

WHY IT WORKS:
[Why this is a legitimate question any buyer should ask, and
why the answer naturally favors your product]

EXPECTED ANSWER:
[What the prospect will likely say, which opens a door for you]

FOLLOW-UP:
"[How to build on their answer to advance your positioning]"

CAUTION:
[What to watch out for -- when this question might backfire]
```

### Landmine Question Quality Test

Before including a landmine question, verify:

1. **Would a thoughtful buyer ask this question independently?** If no, it is a transparent trap and will backfire.
2. **Does the question have a legitimate answer regardless of vendor?** If the only "right" answer is "use your product," it is too obvious.
3. **Can the rep ask it naturally without it sounding rehearsed?** Practice saying it out loud.

## Objection Handler Format (ABD)

### Full Structure

```
OBJECTION: "[Exact words the prospect would say]"
CATEGORY: [Price / Feature / Market Position / Switching Cost / UX / Social Proof]

RESPONSE (ABD Framework):

ACKNOWLEDGE:
"[Validate their concern. Show you heard them. 1 sentence.]"

BRIDGE:
"[Shift to a criterion that matters more for their situation. 1-2 sentences.]"

DIFFERENTIATE:
"[Show how you excel on the bridged criterion. Include proof. 2-3 sentences.]"

FULL RESPONSE (as the rep would say it):
"[Acknowledge + Bridge + Differentiate combined into natural speech.
This is what the rep actually says on the call.]"

PROOF POINTS:
- [Supporting evidence #1]
- [Supporting evidence #2]

DO NOT SAY:
- "[Common mistake #1 -- and why it hurts you]"
- "[Common mistake #2 -- and why it hurts you]"

REDIRECT QUESTION:
"[Question to ask after the response that moves the conversation forward]"
```

### ABD Example: Fully Worked

```
OBJECTION: "Your competitor is cheaper -- their pricing is almost half yours."
CATEGORY: Price

ACKNOWLEDGE:
"That's a fair point -- their sticker price is lower."

BRIDGE:
"What we've found is that sticker price is only part of the cost equation.
The real question is total cost of ownership over 12 months."

DIFFERENTIATE:
"When you factor in implementation time (we deploy in 2 weeks vs. their
8-12 weeks), the admin overhead (our platform requires no dedicated admin
vs. their typical 0.5 FTE), and the productivity gain our customers see
(average 5 hours per rep per week), the total cost picture looks very different.
One customer calculated they saved $180K in the first year after factoring in
everything -- despite our higher license cost."

FULL RESPONSE:
"That's a fair point -- their sticker price is lower. What we've found,
though, is that sticker price is only part of the equation. When our
customers compare total cost of ownership -- including implementation time,
admin overhead, and the productivity gains -- the math actually favors us.
One team calculated they saved $180K in year one despite the higher license
cost. Would it be helpful if I walked through that breakdown for your team size?"

PROOF POINTS:
- 2-week deployment vs. 8-12 week competitor average
- No dedicated admin required (saves 0.5 FTE)
- 5 hours/rep/week productivity gain (customer survey data)
- $180K first-year savings case study (customer: [Name])

DO NOT SAY:
- "You get what you pay for." (Dismissive. Implies they're being cheap.)
- "They're cheap for a reason." (Bashing. Loses credibility.)
- "Price shouldn't be the deciding factor." (Tells the buyer their concern is invalid.)

REDIRECT QUESTION:
"Would it be helpful if I mapped out the total cost comparison for
your team size and deal volume? That usually clarifies the picture."
```

## Battlecard Maintenance Protocol

### Freshness Requirements

| Component | Review Frequency | Trigger for Immediate Update |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Competitor overview | Quarterly | Funding round, acquisition, leadership change |
| Feature comparison | Monthly | Product launch, feature announcement |
| Pricing information | Monthly | Pricing page change, customer report of new pricing |
| Win themes | Quarterly | Competitive win/loss data shows themes are not landing |
| Objection handlers | Monthly | New objection surfaces in 3+ deals |
| Landmine questions | Quarterly | Competitive landscape shifts |
| Recent intel | Weekly | Any always-track event (see SKILL.md) |

### Staleness Warning Signs

- Battlecard references a competitor feature that has been deprecated or replaced
- Win theme cites a product capability that has been matched by the competitor
- Pricing information is more than 3 months old
- No recent intel entries in the last 30 days
- Win/loss data contradicts the battlecard's positioning

### Update Sources

1. **Competitive win/loss interviews**: The most valuable source. Talk to reps who won and lost against this competitor.
2. **G2/Capterra review monitoring**: Set alerts for new reviews mentioning the competitor.
3. **Competitor product changelog**: Monitor their release notes for feature launches.
4. **Competitor website monitoring**: Check pricing page and feature pages monthly.
5. **Deal debriefs**: Include "competitive dynamics" as a standard debrief question.
