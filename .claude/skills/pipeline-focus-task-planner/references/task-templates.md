### Re-Engagement Outreach

**When**: Contact has gone dark (7+ days), champion silent, deal stalling
**Duration**: 20-25 min

```
Template:
  Title: "Re-engage {contact_name} at {company} — {days} days dark"
  Description: {contact_name} has not responded in {days} days. The deal ({deal_name},

  Success criteria: Re-engagement sent with a new value angle (not "just checking in"),
    follow-up reminder set, outcome logged.
```

**Anti-patterns to avoid**:
- "Just checking in" -- provides zero value to the recipient
- "Did you get my last email?" -- passive-aggressive and annoying
- "Circling back" -- corporate jargon that signals desperation
- Sending the same message again -- if it did not work the first time, change the angle

## Quality Standards for Checklist Items

Every checklist item in the engagement task must meet these standards.

### The Colleague Test

**Ask**: "Could a colleague execute this checklist item with zero additional context?"

| Passes | Fails |
|--------|-------|
| "Email Sarah Chen the revised pricing sheet with the 15% volume discount she requested on Tuesday's call" | "Follow up with Sarah" |
| "Call Mike Ross at TechFlow to ask about the budget committee meeting outcome from last Thursday" | "Check in with Mike" |
| "Draft 3 discovery questions for the Meridian Health call focused on their Q2 migration timeline" | "Prep for Meridian call" |

### Required Elements

Every checklist item must include:

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Verb | What to do | "Send," "Call," "Draft," "Review," "Schedule" |
| Target | Who/what | "Sarah Chen at Acme," "the proposal," "CRM records" |
| Specifics | What exactly | "revised pricing with volume discount," "3 discovery questions on budget" |
| Time estimate | How long | "(~15 min)" |

### Anti-Patterns

| Bad Checklist Item | Problem | Better Version |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| "Work on Acme deal" | Not specific, not actionable | "Send Acme the contract with updated payment terms (~15 min)" |
| "Research stuff" | Vague scope, no outcome | "Review CloudPeak's recent earnings call for Q2 priorities (~20 min)" |
| "Follow up" | No specifics on method, content, or target | "Email David Kim the FinServ case study and propose Thursday for a demo (~15 min)" |
| "Update CRM" | No specifics on what to update | "Update DataBridge deal: change stage to Proposal, log yesterday's call notes (~5 min)" |
