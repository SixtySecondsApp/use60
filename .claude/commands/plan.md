## STEP 0: Select Model Profile

Before proceeding, ask the user to select which model profile to use:
- **Economy** — Fastest, lowest cost
- **Balanced** — Good balance of speed & accuracy
- **Thorough** — Most accurate, highest cost

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool with these options.

**Note**: Based on selection, appropriate models will be assigned:
- Economy: Simple plans, quick sketches
- Balanced: Standard planning, most use cases
- Thorough: Complex architectures, strategic planning
